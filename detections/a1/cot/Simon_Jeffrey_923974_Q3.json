          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, user input is bound to variables strictly in the order that input-reading methods are called and assigned. Scanner.nextDouble() just returns the next token from the input stream; it has no knowledge of variable names or the text printed to the console. In this program, the first token entered after the prompt is stored in y1 and the second in x1, and similarly for y2 and x2. That means the program is actually treating the user's first number as the y-coordinate and the second as the x-coordinate, contrary to the prompt. For the distance formula, swapping x and y for both points does not change the numeric result, so the bug is hidden, but conceptually the coordinates are mis-bound. The gap is between thinking Java associates input with variables by name/prompt and the reality that association is purely determined by the sequence of assignments.",
