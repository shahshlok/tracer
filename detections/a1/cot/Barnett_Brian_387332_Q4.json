          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing a single coordinate prompt, such as '(x1, y1):', is sufficient to instruct the user to enter two required input tokens (x1 and y1) consecutively, and the two subsequent calls to input.nextDouble() will automatically associate with this single prompt output.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The execution model treats output (prompts) and sequential input consumption (Scanner calls) as independent operations. Although the code correctly consumes two tokens from the input stream for x1 and y1, relying on one prompt for two variables leads to poor usability and ambiguity regarding the expected input sequence or format. The student misunderstands the necessity of providing explicit guidance to the user for sequential variable inputs.",
          "error_manifestation": "Poor clarity in user interaction/misleading prompts. For example, a user might enter '00' expecting it to be split into 0 and 0, which would normally be consumed as a single token '00.0' by the first call to nextDouble(), causing a runtime error or unexpected input assignment if the subsequent inputs were insufficient.",
