          "conceptual_gap": "To compute the length of a side between two points, Java must be given the exact arithmetic structure of the distance formula: `Math.sqrt((x2 - x1)*(x2 - x1) + (y2 - y1)*(y2 - y1))`. Java does not infer mathematical intent; it follows strict operator precedence and left-to-right associativity. In the student's code, `x2 - x1*x2 - x1 + y2 - y1*y2 - y1` is parsed as `(((x2 - (x1 * x2)) - x1) + y2) - (y1 * y2) - y1`, not as `(x2 - x1)*(x2 - x1) + (y2 - y1)*(y2 - y1)`. This leads to values inside the square root that are not the squared distances (and can even be negative), so `Math.sqrt` can return `NaN` instead of a valid side length. The gap is that the student is treating Java arithmetic as if it automatically matches the high-level algebraic formula, rather than needing explicit parentheses and repeated multiplication to represent squaring.",
