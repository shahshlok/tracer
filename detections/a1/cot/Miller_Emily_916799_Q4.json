          "conceptual_gap": "While the code structure `System.out.print(\"(x1, y1):\"); double x1 = input.nextDouble(); double y1 = input.nextDouble();` is syntactically correct for reading two doubles, the accompanying sample input `(x1, y1):00` suggests the student might expect or encourage the consolidation of multiple numeric inputs immediately adjacent to each other without separators, or that the `Scanner` would somehow parse '00' into two distinct numbers (0 and 0). If the user physically enters '00' without spacing, `nextDouble()` consumes '00' as a single value (0.0), potentially leading to an `InputMismatchException` or assigning unexpected values to subsequent variables if the input stream is structured exactly like the sample output implies.",
          "error_manifestation": "Potential `InputMismatchException` or incorrect variable assignment if the user strictly follows the poorly formatted sample input '00', '50', '05' without separators or newlines, since '00' cannot be parsed into two distinct doubles (x and y) by two sequential calls to `nextDouble()`.",
