Because `startingVelocity` (0.0), `endingVelocity` (0.0), and `timeInSeconds` (0.0) are initialized to zero, the calculation `(endingVelocity - startingVelocity) / timeInSeconds` results in `0.0 / 0.0`. In Java's floating-point arithmetic (IEEE 754), this operation is legal but results in `NaN`, permanently polluting the variable `acceleration`. Although this stored `NaN` does not affect the final printed output, it represents an uncontrolled and undesirable state in the program's memory.",
