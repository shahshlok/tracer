          "conceptual_gap": "The Java `Scanner` tokenizes input based on explicit delimiters (usually whitespace, newline, or tab). If a user enters '05' without separating spaces or newlines, `nextDouble()` attempts to consume the entirety as a single token (5.0 or 0.5 depending on context, or 5.0 in this case if the first digit is dropped), or blocks if the input is treated as 50.0. For the code to work correctly and read 0.0 and 5.0 sequentially, the user must explicitly separate the six coordinate numbers using spaces or newlines, contradicting the visual representation in the sample run.",

          "conceptual_gap": "There is no conceptual gap regarding core Java execution. The code correctly uses two sequential `nextDouble()` calls to read two separate numerical tokens (x1 then y1) from the input stream, which is exactly how input parsing works. Although the prompt format in the sample run ('00', '50', '05') suggests a user typing concatenated numbers which might lead to `InputMismatchException` if not typed with spaces, the standard interpretation assumes space-separated doubles (e.g., '0 0', '5 0', '0 5'). If the student were attempting to read '00' as two separate numbers, Java would handle it correctly if '00' was entered as '0 0'. The code itself is technically correct for reading two doubles sequentially following a single prompt.",
