          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, an assignment statement is executed immediately: the right-hand side expression is evaluated using the current values of its variables at that exact point in time, and the resulting numeric value is stored in the left-hand variable. Here, `v0`, `v1`, and `t` are all 0.0 when line 17 runs, so `(v1 - v0) / t` becomes `0.0 / 0.0`, which is `NaN` for a `double`. The variable `a` therefore permanently stores `NaN` unless it is explicitly reassigned later. It does not stay as a symbolic formula that automatically recomputes when `v0`, `v1`, or `t` change (if they ever did). The comment `// get acceleration ready here` suggests the student is thinking of the assignment more like a mathematical definition or spreadsheet cell formula than a one-time computation in an imperative language.",

In the actual Java execution model:\n- Assignments are one-time evaluations, not persistent equations.\n- Later changes to `v0`, `v1`, or `t` do **not** retroactively change `a`.\n- To get an updated acceleration, the program must execute another assignment like `a = (v1 - v0) / t;` after updating those variables.\n\nIn this particular program, `a` is never used later, so the incorrect NaN value has no visible effect.
