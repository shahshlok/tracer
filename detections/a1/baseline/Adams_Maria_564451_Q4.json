          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly uses `nextDouble()` sequentially to capture two numeric inputs from the user on the same line, which works precisely because `Scanner` handles token separation (whitespace) effectively. The misconception is not about functionality, but about user experience design: they use a single `System.out.print` statement followed by two separate input calls without providing distinct prompts for X and Y values, leading to poor user interface design where the program appears to hang or require unintuitive input formatting unless the user knows to provide both values followed by Enter.",
