The prompt explicitly states 'Enter x1 and y1' and 'Enter x2 and y2', indicating the user will enter values in that order (x-coordinate first, then y-coordinate). By calling `y1 = scan.nextDouble()` before `x1 = scan.nextDouble()`, the code swaps which input value is assigned to which variable, causing x1 and y1 to be reversed from what the user intends.
