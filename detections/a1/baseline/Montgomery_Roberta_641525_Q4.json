          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that a single call to Scanner.nextDouble() can read multiple input values separated by whitespace or be implicitly linked to a following call to read the next token, corresponding to the single system prompt asking for (x, y).",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to understand that `System.out.print(\"(x1, y1):\");` prints only once, but their subsequent code `X1 = INPUT.nextDouble();` and `Y1 = INPUT.nextDouble();` requires two separate numbers separated by whitespace (or pressing Enter) in the console input buffer. If the user provides input like '00' for the prompt, `nextDouble()` reads the first '0' and the second '0' is then read by the next call for `Y1`, leading to unexpected input behavior compared to the sample output which suggests a single input '00' might represent (0, 0). Importantly, since the prompt implies reading (x, y) coordinates, the code structure encourages the user to type the coordinates sequentially, but the sample run format ('00', '50', '05') strongly suggests a misunderstanding of how to prompt for and consume coordinate pairs.",
          "error_manifestation": "Incorrect interpretation of user input, leading to wrong variable assignment if the user strictly follows the sample run's input style ('00', '50', '05'), or confusing input prompts if the user tries to input pairs correctly (e.g., '0 0').",
