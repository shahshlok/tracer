          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that printing a prompt and then calling `input.nextDouble()` twice in subsequent lines will automatically consume exactly two numbers from the input stream, regardless of how the user formats the input, and that the prompts must be separate print statements.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the code correctly uses `nextDouble()` to parse tokens, the input structure shown in the sample run `(x1, y1):00` implies the user might input two values immediately adjacent (e.g., '0' followed by '0' without separation, or even '00' intended as two separate zeros). While standard Scanner behavior usually handles space or newline delimiters, the student has separated the reading logic from the prompt display. For example, the student uses `System.out.print ( \"(x1, y1):\" ) ;`, followed by two separate `input.nextDouble()` calls, leading to confusing user interaction where the user might expect to input coordinates on separate lines or separate prompts according to typical console interaction patterns, rather than relying on Scanner to read two whitespace-separated tokens immediately after the prompt.",
          "error_manifestation": "Confusing or non-robust user input experience. While the code is technically correct if the user enters space-separated doubles (e.g., '0 0'), the sequence of prompts and reads does not naturally guide the user to provide the six required inputs efficiently or clearly, given the structure of the sample output.",

          "conceptual_gap": "Since `side1`, `side2`, and `side3` are defined as `double`, their sum `(side1 + side2 + side3)` is also a `double`. Dividing this `double` by the integer literal `2` would automatically promote `2` to `2.0` for floating-point division. Explicitly writing `2.0` is redundant, suggesting the student might be overly cautious or confusing Java's automatic widening conversions.",
