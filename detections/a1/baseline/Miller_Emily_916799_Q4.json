          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that a single call to `input.nextDouble()` will read the entire `x,y` pair when provided as `xy` (e.g., '00', '50', '05') without a separator, or that the `Scanner` implicitly manages the lack of separation when reading multiple doubles consecutively.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands how `Scanner.nextDouble()` interacts with input tokens, especially when tokens are provided without separators (like spaces or newlines) as suggested by the sample run '00', '50', '05'. In Java, repeated calls to `nextDouble()` requires tokens to be separated by whitespace (or for the user to hit Enter). The sample run provided in the prompt suggests the user enters them immediately after the prompt without spaces, e.g., typing '0' then '0' and hitting enter, or typing '00' and hitting enter. If '00' is entered and followed by Enter, the first `nextDouble()` consumes '00' (reading 0.0) and the second `nextDouble()` waits for a new token, leading to an input mismatch or hanging depending on the subsequent actual input structure. If the user strictly follows the sample run's visual appearance and enters two digits without a separator, the code expects two distinct double tokens for x and y.",
          "error_manifestation": "If the user enters coordinate pairs without separation (as implied by the sample 00, 50, 05), the program will fail to read the input correctly, potentially leading to an InputMismatchException or incorrect variable assignments.",
