          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, an assignment like `double a = (v1 - v0) / t;` is evaluated immediately at that point in execution using the *current* values of `v1`, `v0`, and `t`. The resulting numeric value is stored in `a` and will not change automatically if `v1`, `v0`, or `t` are later reassigned. The comment `// get acceleration ready here` combined with computing `a` before any meaningful input suggests the student may be thinking in terms of defining a persistent formula instead of understanding that Java variables hold fixed values until explicitly reassigned. In this particular program, `a` is never used, so the misconception does not cause an incorrect output, but in a similar pattern where `v1`, `v0`, or `t` were changed later, `a` would remain stale and produce wrong results.",

Here, `v0`, `v1`, and `t` are all `0` when `a` is computed, so `a` becomes the result of `0.0 / 0.0` (NaN) and will stay that way unless explicitly reassigned. The comment \"get acceleration ready here\" suggests a mental model closer to a spreadsheet or algebraic formula that is permanently linked to its variables, rather than Java's actual execution model.
