          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when reading multiple doubles (or other tokens) consecutively using `nextDouble()`, they must be separated by whitespace, and that entering them immediately following the prompt on the same line, as shown in the Sample Run (e.g., '00'), will be correctly tokenized by the `Scanner` into two distinct double values (0.0 and 0.0).",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the Java `Scanner` is designed to parse inputs based on delimiters (whitespace by default), when reading `nextDouble()` twice consecutively, the input '00' is typically read as a single token, 0.0, leaving the remaining '0' in the buffer. If the system treats '00' as a single integer/double token depending on the implementation context or specific user behavior, or if the student expects '00' to be tokenized into two separate coordinates (e.g., x=0, y=0) due to how the prompt is structured, this indicates a flawed understanding of how `Scanner` parses tokens, especially in contrast to specialized input parsing or fixed-width reading. Based on the sample run ('00' input for (x1, y1)), the student demonstrated a belief that typing two characters immediately adjacent to each other yields two inputs.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The `Scanner` object is typically backed by an input stream (in this case, `System.in`). Leaving streams or resources unclosed can lead to resource leaks and is considered poor practice in Java, though for `System.in`, it rarely causes visible issues in short programs. The primary conceptual gap is an incomplete mental model of how operating system resources (like input streams) are managed and released based on explicit instruction in the code.",
