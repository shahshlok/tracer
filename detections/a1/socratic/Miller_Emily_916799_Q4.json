          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that consecutive calls to `input.nextDouble()` will automatically handle token separation regardless of the input formatting provided by the user, likely assuming continuous reading without delimiters necessary between the two coordinates (x and y) entered on the same line.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student is prompting the user to input two values on a single line (e.g., \"(x1, y1):00\"). When the user provides input like '00', Java's `nextDouble()` reads the first '0' as `x1` and then waits for the next token, which is the second '0', to be read as `y1`. While this works for inputs like '00', it shows a weak understanding of how `Scanner` parses tokens, especially in contrast to the sample which uses '00' (suggesting two values entered immediately without space/newline separator recognized by the prompt). If the user enters '5 6', this works fine. The subtle misconception lies in handling the paired input structure derived from the prompt on lines 11/12.",
          "error_manifestation": "If the user inputs coordinates immediately adjacent without delimiters (e.g., '1234'), the scanner will attempt to parse '1234' as the first double (`x1`), leading to an InputMismatchException or parsing error if the non-delimited input is ambiguous, or sometimes incorrectly consuming tokens if the input is parsed successfully but unintentionally (e.g., reading '12' then '34' if entered as '1234'). However, for the sample run '00', '50', '05', this specific input format suggests the student expects the user to enter two numbers without a space, which `nextDouble()` might parse as two tokens if separated by implicit delimiters (like clicking submit between 0 and 0) or fail if entered as a single non-separated string that can't be partitioned into two doubles after the prompt.",
