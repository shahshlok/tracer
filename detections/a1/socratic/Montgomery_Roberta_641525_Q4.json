          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when using a single `System.out.print` prompt followed immediately by two `INPUT.nextDouble()` calls, the Scanner will automatically interpret the two input values provided on the same line (as shown in the sample run '00') correctly, even if they are not separated by mandatory whitespace or treated as two sequential tokens. The student expects the input stream to seamlessly parse `x1` then `y1` from a compact user input like '00'.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The `Scanner.nextDouble()` method relies on tokens separated by delimiters (usually whitespace). While the sample run shows `(x1, y1):00`, which implies the user entered '0' then '0', the student's prompt structure may lead to unexpected behavior if the user attempts to enter coordinate pairs without separating them with a space or pressing Enter between them, especially if the user attempts to mimic the exact compact output/input style shown in the sample. For '00', Java correctly reads the first '0' as X1 and the second '0' as Y1 because '00' is technically two '0' characters processed sequentially if buffered or separated by an implicit delimiter based on tokenization rules, but the expectation that the user will input concatenated numbers without an explicit separator (like space or newline) is based on a weak model of how Scanner tokenizes input.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output or input reading error (InputMismatchException) if the user provides concatenated inputs that confuse the tokenizer (e.g., '1020' might be read as 10.0 for X1 and leave '20' for Y1, or it could try to read '1020' as a single number if the user doesn't hit enter between inputs). However, based on the specific usage of `nextDouble()` twice, this is more likely to cause confusion about required input formatting.",
