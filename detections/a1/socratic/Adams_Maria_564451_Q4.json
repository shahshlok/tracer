          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that calling inputScanner.nextDouble() twice on the same line only consumes the input corresponding to the first prompt or that the user will input two separate numbers that the Scanner will automatically parse sequentially, even if they are on the same line of input.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The java.util.Scanner class's nextDouble() method only reads the next double token from the input stream, advancing the scanner past the input that was matched. When the prompts are combined on the same line like this: `System.out.print(\"(x1, y1): \"); double x1 = inputScanner.nextDouble(); double y1 = inputScanner.nextDouble();`, the student is relying on the user to input two space-separated numbers (e.g., '0' '0') or a specific input format (e.g., '0 0') after the single prompt, which deviates from the provided sample run prompt structure `(x1, y1):00` which implies reading both numbers with a single combined call or a loop. However, given the structure, the Scanner is correctly parsing two separate tokens.",
          "error_manifestation": "Requires user to input space-separated numbers for each coordinate pair (e.g., instead of entering '00' when prompted, the user must enter '0 0'). This is not explicitly an error, but a misunderstanding of how the input is consumed relative to the prompting strategy and the sample run's compact display of '00' immediately after the prompt.",
