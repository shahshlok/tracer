In standard math notation, the fraction bar in `(v1 - v0) / t` visually groups the entire numerator, but Java does not infer that grouping from the way the expression is written; you must explicitly use parentheses: `(v1 - v0) / t`. The student's mental model assumes that writing the symbols in a similar left-to-right order is enough to capture the intended mathematical grouping, ignoring the language's actual parsing rules.",
