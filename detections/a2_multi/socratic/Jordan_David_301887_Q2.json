          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that once the guess equals the answer, the loop will stop and therefore no further output inside the loop matters; they may not have considered that their if/else chain has no explicit 'correct' branch, and that the 'correct' message is handled only after the loop ends.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the loop condition is checked at the top of each iteration. Inside the loop, Java executes statements exactly as written. If the guess becomes correct during an iteration, the loop does not 'retroactively' skip the rest of that iteration\u2014but in this program, once the user enters a correct guess, neither the '<' nor '>' branch runs, so the iteration produces no feedback and then the next loop check fails and execution continues after the loop. This works, but it relies on understanding that the 'correct' case is implicitly 'do nothing in the loop' rather than explicitly handled.",
          "error_manifestation": "Potentially confusing behavior/design: on the final correct guess, the program prints no immediate 'Correct!' response until after the loop; students sometimes expect an in-loop message.",
