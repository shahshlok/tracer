          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, certain objects like Scanners and File streams hold onto system-level resources.

In Java, 'for' loops are the standard notional tool for fixed-range iteration because they unify these three parts, reducing the risk of skipping an increment or mishandling the counter's scope.",
