          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java execution model, the code following a 'while' block is only executed once the loop's condition becomes false. The student doesn't realize that the loop termination itself acts as a logical branch; therefore, checking for equality inside the loop (via 'else') is redundant because the code outside the loop already 'knows' the guess is correct by virtue of the loop ending.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code contains a redundant logical check (effectively checking if userGuess == answer twice: once at the top of the loop and once in the else block). While the code runs correctly, it indicates a mental model where the while loop is seen only as a container for repetition rather than a logical gatekeeper.",

The do-while loop is specifically designed for scenarios where the body must execute at least once before the condition is checked, avoiding the need for a 'sentinel' value.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program relies on the fact that '0' is not a valid answer (since the range is 1-100) to ensure the loop enters the first time. If the target 'answer' could be 0, the program would fail to start.",
