          "conceptual_gap": "While this logic works for simple loops, it ignores Java's convention of 0-based indexing used for strings and arrays. A mental model rooted in 1-based counting will fail when the student attempts to use the loop counter as an index for data structures.",

While the compiler ignores whitespace, consistent indentation is essential for a programmer to correctly identify the scope of variables and the limits of control structures.",
