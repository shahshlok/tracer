          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `System.out.print(...)` only sends characters to the console output stream; it has no effect on `Scanner` or what gets read. Input happens only when you call methods like `nextInt()`, which parse tokens from `System.in` regardless of what prompt text you printed.",
          "error_manifestation": "Usually no visible error in this program (it still works), but this belief can lead to confusion when input isn\u2019t read as expected, or when prompts are omitted/changed and the student expects input behavior to change.",

The student may not fully realize that the 'println()' is outside the inner loop only because of the semicolon after the 'print(\"*\")' statement, rather than because of how it is physically arranged on the line.",
          "error_manifestation": "This can lead to logic errors if the student attempts to add a second statement to the inner loop (e.g., a counter) without adding braces, as they might expect physical proximity on the same line to determine the loop's scope.",
