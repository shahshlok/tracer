          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the loop condition is checked using the *current stored value* of `x` at the start of each iteration. Initializing `x` is necessary for compilation (definite assignment), but the program\u2019s correctness comes from reading input each iteration, not from picking a \u201cmagic\u201d initial value. A cleaner mental model is: variables don\u2019t \u2018cause\u2019 the loop to run; the boolean condition does, and `x` only changes when you explicitly assign it (here, via `x = s.nextInt()`).",
