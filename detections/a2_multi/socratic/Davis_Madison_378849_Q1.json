          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, there is no semantic link between the string literal printed to the console and the control logic of the program. The student perceives the '5' in the prompt and the '5' in the loop as a single requirement of the problem that must be 'mirrored' in both places for the computer to process the instruction correctly.",
          "error_manifestation": "Logic fragility; if the student were to change the prompt to 'Enter 10 integers', the program would still only process 5, likely surprising the student who expects the computer to 'know' the count from the text.",

Declaring variables like the loop counter 'i' and the temporary input 'n' at the top, rather than within the 'for' loop header or the loop body, suggests a mental model where declaration is a separate pre-execution phase rather than part of the logical flow.",

The student's mental model treats the computer as a math-solver rather than a logic-executor that requires descriptive identifiers for maintainability and clarity.",
          "error_manifestation": "Reduced code readability; as the program grows in complexity, using names like 'y' for a sum and 'x' for a Scanner makes debugging significantly harder as the identifiers carry no semantic meaning.",

Declaring variables like 'i' and 'n' at the top level instead of within the 'for' loop or loop body is a stylistic holdover from languages like C (C89), and it ignores Java's ability to limit variable scope to the specific block where they are needed.",
