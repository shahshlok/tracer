The student's mental model relies on 'priming' the variable with an out-of-bounds value rather than using structures designed for this purpose, such as a do-while loop or a boolean flag, which more accurately reflect that no guess has been made yet.",

Their mental model separates the UI (the prompt string) from the backend logic (the Random calculation), not realizing that the machine treats them as unrelated literals.
