          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a loop (like `while`) controls exactly one statement as its body unless you use `{ ... }` to form a block. Newlines/indentation don\u2019t matter to the compiler\u2014only braces and semicolons do. In this specific code, the student happens to have placed everything they want inside the loop as one compound-looking line, but Java is still interpreting it as a sequence of separate statements, where only the *first statement* after `while(i<5)` is considered the loop body unless braces are used. Beginners often miss that Java doesn\u2019t group statements by indentation or \u201cline\u201d.",
          "error_manifestation": "This misconception can lead to logic errors (e.g., the loop not repeating the intended set of statements), including infinite loops or reading the wrong number of inputs.
