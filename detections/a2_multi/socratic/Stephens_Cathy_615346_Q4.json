While using 1-based indexing is mathematically equivalent for simple counts, it indicates the student is conceptualizing the computer's process as a physical count rather than a sequence of offsets. This model often results in 'off-by-one' errors when the student begins working with zero-indexed structures like arrays, lists, or strings.",
