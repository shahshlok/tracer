          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a `while` loop checks its condition before each iteration. If you want the body to run at least once, you either (a) ensure the condition is initially true (as the student did by setting `userGuess` to a value that\u2019s almost surely not the answer), or (b) use a `do { ... } while (...)` loop which guarantees one iteration. The subtle gap is that the student may not fully trust/understand when the condition is evaluated and is compensating with a \u201csentinel\u201d initial value rather than reasoning about loop structure.",
