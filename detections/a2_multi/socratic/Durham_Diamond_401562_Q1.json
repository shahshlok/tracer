They think this is the standard, expected way to handle multiple inputs in Java.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has not yet internalized the concept of loops (for or while) as a control structure that can repeat operations over multiple iterations. Instead of recognizing that the same operation (read an integer, check if even, add to sum) needs to be performed 5 times, they manually write out this logic 5 times. This reveals a gap between understanding 'repeat this logic N times' and implementing that with loop constructs. The student may not yet see the pattern or may not be confident enough in loop syntax to refactor.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code works correctly for the sample input and produces the right output (14), so there is no runtime error or incorrect result. However, the approach does not scale and violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, suggesting the student has not yet grasped iteration as a fundamental programming concept.",
