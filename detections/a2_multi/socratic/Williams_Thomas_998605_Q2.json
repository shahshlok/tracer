          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java execution model, while loops check the condition before the first iteration. While the student's solution works, it demonstrates a mental model where they must manufacture a 'fake' state (setting the guess to 0, which is outside the 1-100 range) to 'prime' the engine. This suggests they may not yet understand that program structure (like a do-while loop) can naturally handle logic where the data for the condition is generated inside the loop itself.",

In the Java execution model, if a while loop with this condition finishes, the code immediately following the loop can safely assume the guess is correct. The student's mental model treats the while loop as a general container for 'running the game' and the if/else-if/else block as the 'actual logic', leading to checking the same equality relationship multiple times in the final iteration.",
