          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's execution model, while starting at 1 is logically sound for counting, the language and its notional machine are built on zero-based indexing. Starting loops at 1 is a human-centric mental model rather than a machine-centric one (offsets). This model often leads to off-by-one errors when students begin interacting with zero-indexed structures like arrays or strings.",
