Local variables declared within a method must be explicitly initialized before they are accessed for the first time. While this code avoids a compile error because 'y' is assigned a value via 's.nextInt()' before it is read in the 'if' condition, the pattern of declaring without initializing suggests a reliance on implicit defaults.",

'nextInt()' expects a strict integer format; if a user enters a decimal (e.g., 3.5) or a string (e.g., 'three'), the machine enters an error state and throws an InputMismatchException.
