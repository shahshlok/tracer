          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, an `if/else if` chain only executes one of the listed branches when its condition is true. If `guess == answer`, then neither `guess < answer` nor `guess > answer` is true, so nothing in that chain runs. The program doesn\u2019t \"know\" to print \"Correct\" at that moment unless you code a specific condition/action. In this specific program, correctness is handled by exiting the `while` loop and printing afterward, which works\u2014but it also means there is no message on the exact iteration except via the post-loop print.",

The computer treats the characters '1', '0', '0' inside the quotes as literal text rather than a reference to the variable 'a'.
