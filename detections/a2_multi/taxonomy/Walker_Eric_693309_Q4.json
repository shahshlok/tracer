In other words, they treat a derived formula as automatically matching the intended count without carefully mapping it to loop semantics (inclusive bounds).",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `for (int i = start; i <= end; i++)` executes `(end - start + 1)` iterations because both ends are inclusive. If you want N rows starting at 1, the correct end is N (or use `<` with N+1). Introducing `a`, `b`, and `c` is fine, but the algebra has to match the inclusive loop rule. Here, with `a = 1`, `b = N`, and `c = b - a + 1`, the loop runs from 1 to N (since c becomes N), but the expression is coincidentally correct only because `a` is 1. If `a` changed, the formula would break (you\u2019d no longer get N rows).",

In a for loop with condition i <= c, when a=1 and c=N, the loop will iterate from i=1 to i=N correctly by coincidence. However, the logic is conceptually flawed: the student is computing c as if it's a range size (which it is: N - 1 + 1 = N), but then using it directly as an upper bound.
