          "conceptual_gap": "The student has a misconception about when loop conditions are evaluated. In reality, the while loop condition is checked at the START of each iteration. Since `guess` is initialized to 0 and `answer` is a random number between 1-100, the condition `guess != answer` will always be true on the first iteration. However, the actual flow is correct in this code: the condition IS checked before entering the loop body, and the loop WILL exit when guess equals answer. The issue is more subtle: the student may not fully understand that the condition must become FALSE for the loop to exit, and that this happens only AFTER a correct guess is entered and the loop condition is re-evaluated at the top of the next iteration. This code actually works correctly, but reveals a potential misunderstanding of the precise moment the condition is checked relative to the output statement.",

However, the student may not realize that after discarding bad input, the loop immediately re-checks the condition (guess != answer) without actually getting a valid guess, which is correct behavior but may indicate incomplete understanding of the flow when input is invalid.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The actual behavior is correct: when non-integer input is provided, scanner.next() discards it, the loop continues to the next iteration, the condition is re-checked, and since guess still hasn't changed, the loop asks for input again. However, the structure suggests the student may not fully appreciate that in the else branch, no guess value is obtained, so the condition remains unchanged.
