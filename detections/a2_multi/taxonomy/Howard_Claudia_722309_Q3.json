          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to understand the 'sequential exclusion' property of the if-else-if construct. In a properly understood notional machine, the second branch in an if-else-if ladder is only reachable if the first condition evaluates to false. Thus, checking the upper bound (e.g., <= 89) is redundant because the code can only reach that check if the grade was already proven to be less than 90. Furthermore, the student checks 'safeNumericGrade <= 100' despite having already clamped the value to 100 in the preceding lines, showing a lack of awareness of the machine's current state.",
