          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that assigning the result of an operation to an intermediate variable (newSum) and then assigning that to the target variable (sum) is necessary or provides additional clarity/safety compared to directly modifying sum.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the code is functionally correct, the student demonstrates a misconception about assignment efficiency and variable scope. The student may believe that creating an intermediate variable protects the original variable or that the two-step assignment is required. In reality, `sum = sum + value;` is the idiomatic approach in Java, and the intermediate variable is unnecessary. This suggests the student may have a slight misunderstanding about how assignment works or may be overly cautious about modifying variables.",
          "error_manifestation": "No error occurs; the code produces correct output. However, this pattern suggests a conceptual gap in understanding direct variable modification and may indicate the student lacks confidence in assignment operations.",
