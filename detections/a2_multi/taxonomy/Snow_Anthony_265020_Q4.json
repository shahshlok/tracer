They may have confused which variable needs to be incremented, or thought that incrementing the outer loop variable inside the inner loop would help control the inner loop's progression.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not understand that a for loop's increment section must modify the same variable referenced in the loop condition to make the loop progress toward termination. When a different variable is incremented, the condition's control variable never changes, causing an infinite loop. The student appears to conflate the role of the loop control variable with other variables.",
