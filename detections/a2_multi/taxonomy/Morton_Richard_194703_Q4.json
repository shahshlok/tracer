          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the 'for' loop header is designed to encapsulate declaration, initialization, and incrementing. Declaring the variables outside the header (as done on lines 16 and 26) is a legacy style that suggests a mental model where memory management and control flow are strictly decoupled.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student creates a redundant variable 'numberOfStarsInRow' on line 23 to store the value of 'currentRowNumber'. This implies a mental model where the computer requires a 'mapping' step to understand that the row count and the star count are the same number, rather than simply referencing 'currentRowNumber' directly in the inner loop's condition.",
