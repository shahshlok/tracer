When the correct guess is entered, the condition userGuessValue != secretNumberAnswer becomes false, causing the loop to exit before the success message can be printed. In reality, the loop exits when the condition is evaluated as false at the beginning of the next iteration, which means the congratulatory message inside the loop will never execute.",
