          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not understand that rand.nextInt(100) returns a value in the range [0, 99], not [1, 100]. By adding 1 to this result, the range becomes [1, 100], which is correct. However, the student's intermediate variable 'a' stores the result of nextInt(100), which is already in [0, 99]. The actual code happens to work correctly by accident (a + 1 gives [1, 100]), but this suggests the student may not fully grasp the behavior of nextInt().",

However, the student initialized 'guess = 0' at line 10, which means the first comparison happens before any user input is read. If the answer happens to be 0 (which is impossible since answer is in [1, 100]), the loop would not execute at all.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Although the code works in practice because answer is always >= 1 and guess starts at 0, the initialization pattern suggests the student may not fully appreciate that the loop condition is evaluated before the loop body executes. A more robust approach would be to use a do-while loop or to initialize guess to a sentinel value that ensures at least one iteration.",
