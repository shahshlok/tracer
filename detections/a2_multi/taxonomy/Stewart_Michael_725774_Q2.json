Specifically, they believe they must calculate the difference between two values and then check the sign of that difference to determine the relationship between the variables, rather than comparing them directly.",
          "conceptual_gap": "Java provides direct relational operators (>, <, ==) that can be used on any primitive numeric variables. The student's mental model assumes an extra step of mathematical reduction is necessary, whereas the Java notional machine allows direct comparison of any two primitive values without computing a difference first.",

They believe they must store the result of the logic in a 'indicator' variable before the computer can perform an I/O action based on that result.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java execution model, the branches of an 'if' statement are not merely for setting state; they are entry points for any executable code, including method calls like System.out.println.
