Once a grade fails the first condition (grade >= 90 AND grade <= 100), any grade that enters the second condition (grade >= 80) must be in the range 80-89, without needing explicit upper bound checks. The student is treating each condition as independent rather than understanding how if-else chains partition the input space.",

Therefore, a grade of 105 will fail the first 'if' but will satisfy the 'else if (grade >= 80)' branch, resulting in a 'B' grade. The computer does not 'carry over' the <= 100 constraint.",
