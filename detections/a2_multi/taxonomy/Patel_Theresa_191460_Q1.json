          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that to update a variable, they must create a new intermediate variable to hold the calculated result, and then assign it back to the original variable. They think each operation requires an explicit separate variable to hold its result before assigning.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a variable can be updated directly using compound operations or simple reassignment. The statement `sumOfEvenNumbers = sumOfEvenNumbers + currentUserInputValue;` is perfectly valid and idiomatic. Creating an intermediate variable `newSumOfEvenNumbers` and then assigning it back adds unnecessary complexity. The student appears to believe that the assignment target (left side) cannot also appear in the expression (right side), or that doing so requires an intermediary.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error or incorrect output; the code executes correctly. However, this reveals a misconception about variable assignment semantics and demonstrates overly cautious or redundant programming practices that suggest the student doesn't fully trust the assignment operation.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While the student's approach is not technically wrong, it reveals unfamiliarity with or lack of confidence in the for-loop construct, which is the standard idiom for counted loops in Java. The student uses a while loop with manual initialization and increment, which is more verbose and error-prone. The pattern suggests the student views the loop counter initialization as something that must be done separately and explicitly outside the loop structure, rather than integrated into the loop itself as in a for-loop.",
