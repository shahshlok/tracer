          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that when `scanner.hasNextInt()` returns false and they consume the bad token with `scanner.next()`, the loop immediately re-prompts without allowing the user to provide new input. The `guessCount` is not incremented for invalid input, which is correct, but the logic flow doesn't prevent the same invalid input from potentially being re-read or creates a scenario where the user must re-enter input. Additionally, there's no `scanner.nextLine()` call to fully clear the input buffer after consuming a non-integer token, which can cause subsequent reads to fail.",
