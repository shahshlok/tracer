          "conceptual_gap": "The student has a misconception about loop control and the order of operations within a loop. While the code does work correctly for this specific problem, there is a subtle logical issue: the student relies on the condition check at the loop entrance, but they haven't explicitly ensured that the first iteration always executes. More importantly, they haven't considered that initializing userGuess to 0 could potentially match the answer (if answer were 0, though the random range prevents this). The real issue is the placement of the success message inside the loop\u2014after the guess_count is incremented but before the loop exits, which is actually correct here but suggests the student may not fully understand when to exit a loop.",

In well-structured code, the final result would typically be displayed after the loop exits, not within it.
