They think that for the A grade range (90-100), they must write `numeric_grade >= a && numeric_grade <= 100` to ensure the grade falls within that specific range.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't recognize that in a chain of if-else statements, once a condition is satisfied, subsequent conditions are only checked if the previous ones failed. By the time we reach the B condition, we already know the grade is less than 90 (because the A condition failed). Therefore, checking `numeric_grade >= b` (80) is sufficient\u2014there's no need to also check an upper bound of 89. The explicit upper bound check is redundant and suggests a misunderstanding of how if-else control flow narrows the possible values.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code actually produces correct output for the sample run, but it demonstrates flawed reasoning. The unnecessary upper bound check on line 18 (`&& numeric_grade <= 100`) is logically superfluous and suggests the student views each condition as independent rather than as part of a narrowing chain.",
