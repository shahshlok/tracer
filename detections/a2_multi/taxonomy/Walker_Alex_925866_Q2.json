However, the variable naming (a=100, b=1) suggests the student may be thinking of it as 'a random number up to a, starting from b', when actually `nextInt(n)` returns 0 to n-1. The code happens to work correctly, but the mental model suggests the student is relying on coincidence rather than understanding the actual behavior of nextInt().",
