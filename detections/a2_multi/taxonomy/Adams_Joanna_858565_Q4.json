          "conceptual_gap": "While the code technically works, the student has initialized variable 'c' to 1 but never uses it anywhere in the program. This suggests a misunderstanding that all declared variables must be initialized, or that initializing variables at declaration time is required before they can be used in loops. In reality, Java allows variables to be declared without initialization if they are assigned before use, and unnecessary variables create code clutter and confusion.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error or incorrect output, but the code contains dead code (unused variable 'c') which indicates a flawed mental model about variable scope and necessity.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student initializes 'a' and 'b' to 1 in the variable declaration, then immediately reassigns them in the for loop initialization (a=1; and b=1;). While this works, it shows the student may not fully understand that the for loop initialization clause is designed to initialize loop variables, making the pre-initialization redundant. The actual Java execution model has the for loop initialization execute before any iteration, making the initial assignment statement unnecessary.",
