          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that dividing an integer grade by 10 will correctly map all grades in a range to their appropriate letter grade category. For example, they think that grades 90-100 all map to a=9, grades 80-89 map to a=8, etc., without realizing the impact of integer truncation on boundary cases.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student appears unaware that integer division truncates toward zero. While the logic works for most cases (e.g., 85/10=8, 75/10=7), it fails at grade 100: 100/10=10, which doesn't match any of the if conditions (a>=9 checks for >=9, so a=10 would satisfy this, but this is actually luck rather than design). More critically, the student hasn't recognized that they're treating the problem as if division by 10 perfectly partitions the grade ranges, when in reality they should be checking if the original grade falls within specific ranges (e.g., grade >= 90 AND grade <= 100).",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output for boundary cases, particularly grade 100, which produces a=10 instead of a=9. The code accidentally works because 10>=9 is true, but this reveals a flawed mental model about how integer division relates to range checking.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student's mental model treats integer division as a perfect bucketing mechanism, but this only partially works. The correct approach for this problem is to directly compare the original grade against the range boundaries (e.g., if grade >= 90 && grade <= 100). By dividing first, the student is making an implicit assumption that loses information about the exact grade value. While it happens to work in this case due to lucky boundary conditions, it demonstrates a misunderstanding of when and how to use arithmetic operations versus relational operators for range checking.",
