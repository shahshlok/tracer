          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the while loop condition (userGuessValue != secretRandomNumber) will correctly terminate the game when the user guesses correctly. The student thinks that once they print 'Correct! You took X guesses.' inside the else block, the loop will naturally exit on the next iteration because userGuessValue will equal secretRandomNumber.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has a flawed mental model of loop control flow. They do not recognize that after the else block executes (printing the correct message), the loop will check its condition again. At that point, userGuessValue DOES equal secretRandomNumber, so the condition (userGuessValue != secretRandomNumber) evaluates to false and the loop exits. While this produces correct behavior in this case, it reveals a misconception: the student is relying on a lucky accident rather than understanding that either the loop condition should be modified OR an explicit break statement should be used to exit immediately. The student's approach works but suggests they don't fully understand that the condition is re-evaluated after each iteration, not just once when the correct guess is found.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output despite the misconception. The program correctly identifies when the guess matches the secret number and exits the loop. However, the logic is fragile and the student's mental model is incomplete.",
