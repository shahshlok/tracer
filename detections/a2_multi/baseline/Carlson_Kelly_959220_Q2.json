          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a `while (guess != answer)` loop only terminates when `guess` is assigned the value `answer`. If the user keeps entering non-integer input, `guess` is never updated, so the loop can continue indefinitely and the program never reaches the final \"Correct!\" message. Handling invalid input should also re-prompt (which happens) but the student should recognize that termination depends on updating `guess` to a valid value; additionally, it\u2019s often appropriate to provide feedback for invalid input so the user understands why it\u2019s looping.",
