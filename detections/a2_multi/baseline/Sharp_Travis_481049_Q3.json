Once the first condition (userInputGrade >= lowerBoundA) fails, we already know the grade is less than 90, so checking userInputGrade <= 89 in the next branch is logically redundant. The upper bound is implicitly enforced by the failure of previous conditions. While the code still works correctly in this case, it reflects a misunderstanding of how if-else control flow eliminates impossible states.",
