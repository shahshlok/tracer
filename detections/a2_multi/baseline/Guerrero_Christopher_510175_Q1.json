          "conceptual_gap": "While this code happens to read exactly 5 integers and sum the evens, the approach reflects a weak mental model of control flow: the program\u2019s correctness depends on carefully counting and duplicating statements, which is brittle and easy to get wrong when the required count changes or if a statement is missed/duplicated. The intended CS1 concept is iteration (looping) for repeated input processing.",
          "error_manifestation": "No incorrect output for the stated problem (reads 5 ints; sums even ones correctly). However, the conceptual issue commonly manifests as off-by-one input reads (reading 4 or 6 values) or missing a value in similar tasks.",

By reusing variables a and b after the first three reads, the old values are overwritten and lost. The code only actually processes 5 integers (reads them), but the logic for summing even numbers from all 5 is broken because it checks a and b twice while c's second value is never used. The student seems to think that reusing variable names somehow allows them to check multiple distinct values.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output. The code reads 5 integers but fails to check all 5 of them correctly for evenness. Specifically, the 4th and 5th integers are read into a and b, overwriting the first two values, so the 1st and 2nd integers get their evenness checked twice, while the 5th integer (stored in b on the second read) gets checked only once and the 3rd integer never gets checked after being read.",
