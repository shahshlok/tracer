          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `hasNextInt()` is a token-check, not input reading; if it returns false, the invalid token remains in the input buffer and the program does not consume it. Also, the problem statement typically assumes a valid integer is entered, so gating the main logic on `hasNextInt()` (without prompting again or reporting an error) can lead to no output and may not match expected behavior in automated tests.",
