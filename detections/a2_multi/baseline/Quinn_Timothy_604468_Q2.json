          "conceptual_gap": "In this program, the success message is not printed at the moment the correct guess is detected; it is printed only after the loop finishes, and additionally is conditional on `finalCount != 0`. While `finalCount != 0` is always true here (because `guess_count` is incremented before the equality check), the extra conditional reflects a shaky model of control flow and when/why the success message should appear. The correct interaction is: upon a correct guess, immediately report success and number of guesses, then stop. Printing it after the loop happens to work here, but the added condition suggests confusion about whether the loop might end without any guesses or without a correct guess.",
