          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that dividing a numeric grade by 10 and checking the quotient will correctly map all grades to their letter grade ranges. Specifically, they think that dividing 85 by 10 gives 8, which can be directly compared to determine the letter grade category.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has failed to account for how integer division truncates and how boundary conditions work with this approach. When a grade of 89 is divided by 10, the result is 8 (not 8.9), which correctly maps to B. However, the logic breaks at grade boundaries. For example, a grade of 90 divided by 10 gives 9, which correctly maps to A. But the core issue is that this division-based approach is fundamentally flawed for grades below 90: it treats all grades in the 80s (80-89) as 'B', which happens to work for this range, but the student's mental model suggests they believe a simple integer division approach is sufficient for all grading logic without recognizing edge cases or the need for explicit range checking.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code actually produces correct output for the sample input (85 \u2192 B) and for many test cases, but it fails for grades of 100. When the grade is 100, dividing by 10 gives 10, which does not match any of the if-else conditions (a>=9, a==8, a==7, a==6), so it falls through to the else clause and returns 'F' instead of 'A'.
