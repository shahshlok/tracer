The problem states 'reads a numeric grade (0-100)' which is a constraint on valid input, not a requirement that the program must handle out-of-range values. The grading scale is defined for the 0-100 range, and there's no specification requiring the program to clamp invalid inputs. More fundamentally, the student may believe that user input is inherently unreliable or that defensive programming with value clamping is always necessary, when in fact the problem assumes valid input will be provided.",
