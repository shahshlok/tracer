While the algebra here happens to simplify to N given a=1 and b=N, tying correctness to a derived expression introduces an unnecessary dependency on extra variables and assumptions.

While the computation c = b - a + 1 = N - 1 + 1 = N is mathematically correct, the student's mental model treats this as a required 'theoretical' step rather than recognizing that N directly represents the number of rows. This suggests a misunderstanding that loop bounds must be derived through intermediate calculations rather than used directly from input.",

There is no requirement to create 'proxy' variables (like c for N, or stars_in_row for row) to represent these values.
