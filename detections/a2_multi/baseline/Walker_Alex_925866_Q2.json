Therefore, `rand.nextInt(100) + 1` generates numbers from 1 to 100, but assigning 100 and 1 to variables `a` and `b` and then using `rand.nextInt(a) + b` generates numbers from 1 to 100, which happens to be correct by coincidence. However, the student's approach of separating the magic numbers suggests a misunderstanding of why these specific values work. The real issue is conceptual: the student may not grasp that `nextInt(100)` returns 0-99, and adding 1 shifts it to 1-100. Using variable names `a` and `b` obscures this relationship and suggests the student doesn't fully understand the mechanics of the random range.",
