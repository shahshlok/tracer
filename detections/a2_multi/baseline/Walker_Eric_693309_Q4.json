          "conceptual_gap": "To print N rows, the outer loop should directly run N times (e.g., i = 1; i <= N; i++). By setting c = N - 1 + 1 = N and looping i from 1 to N, it happens to work, but the derived bound only works because a is fixed at 1. If a changed, the number of rows would change incorrectly. This indicates a shaky understanding of how to set loop bounds for a required count and introduces an easy-to-miss off-by-one risk.",

The student thinks `c` represents the ending row number rather than the count of rows.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has confused the purpose of the calculation `b - a + 1`. While this formula correctly calculates the COUNT of elements in a range (how many rows exist), the student is using this count as if it were the upper limit of the loop itself. When N=4, the code calculates c=4, which happens to work, but the logic is based on a flawed understanding. The student should either loop `i <= N` directly, or if they wanted to use intermediate variables, they should recognize that `c` represents the total count, not the final row number. The actual loop condition `i <= c` only works coincidentally because (N - 1 + 1) = N.",
