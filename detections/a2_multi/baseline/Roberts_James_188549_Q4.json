However, whether and how to handle N <= 0 is a specification/requirements question, not a Java execution-model issue. Silently doing nothing may conflict with some graders\u2019 expectations (e.g., they might expect at least one row for N=0, an error message, or re-prompting), but it\u2019s not inherently incorrect unless the assignment defines behavior for non-positive N.",
