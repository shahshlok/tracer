          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that the notional machine's evaluation of boolean conditions (such as 'y < t' where y=0 and t <= 0) inherently handles 'out-of-bounds' cases by simply not executing the loop body. This leads to a lack of trust in the determinism of the execution model and the established invariants (e.g., that x + 1 will always be at least 1 if x starts at 0).",
          "error_manifestation": "The code contains unreachable or redundant logic branches that do not change the program's behavior but increase complexity and reveal an insecure mental model of program state.",
