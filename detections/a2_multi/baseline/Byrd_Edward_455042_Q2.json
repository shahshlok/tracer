Since the guess now matches the answer, the condition becomes false and the loop exits\u2014but this happens AFTER the message is printed, not before. However, there's a more fundamental issue: the loop will actually continue requesting input indefinitely because the loop condition only checks if userGuessValue != secretNumberAnswer, and the loop doesn't have any break statement. After printing 'Correct!', the loop continues, asks for another guess, reads it, increments the counter, and only checks the loop condition again. If the new guess doesn't match the original secret number, it prints 'Too high' or 'Too low' again. The loop only exits when a guess exactly matches the secret number AND the loop condition is evaluated at the start of the next iteration.",
