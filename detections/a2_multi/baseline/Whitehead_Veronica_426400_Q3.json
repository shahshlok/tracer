Since grade >= 90 is already checked first, any grade that reaches the next else-if (grade >= 80) must be less than 90. The explicit upper bound check (grade <= 100) is logically redundant and suggests the student views each condition as independent rather than as part of an ordered decision chain where earlier conditions filter the input space.",
