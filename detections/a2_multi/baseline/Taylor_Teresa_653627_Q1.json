The student does not recognize that a loop construct (for or while) can be used to repeat a block of code multiple times.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student lacks understanding of loop abstraction in Java. Loops are a fundamental control structure that allow code to be executed repeatedly without explicit duplication. By writing out the same pattern five times (read integer, check if even, add to sum), the student demonstrates a failure to recognize that this repetitive pattern is exactly what loops are designed for. This suggests a mental model where control flow is viewed as a linear sequence of statements rather than as structures that can repeat blocks of code.",
