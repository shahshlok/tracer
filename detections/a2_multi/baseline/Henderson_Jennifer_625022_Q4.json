Introducing a/b/c as a derived range adds unnecessary indirection and increases the chance of off-by-one errors if a is changed or misunderstood. While it happens to work here because a=1 and b=N, the mental model suggests uncertainty about how to set loop bounds to get exactly N iterations.",

This suggests confusion about what loop variables represent and how they can be used directly without intermediate transformations.",
