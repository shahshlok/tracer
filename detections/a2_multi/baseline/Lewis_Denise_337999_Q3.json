They think that checking `numeric_grade <= 100` in the first condition and `numeric_grade <= 89` in the second condition ensures correct boundaries, rather than relying on the logical flow of mutually exclusive if-else conditions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has not fully grasped that in an if-else chain, once a condition is satisfied, subsequent conditions are not evaluated. Therefore, checking `numeric_grade >= 90` in the first if is sufficient to guarantee that any grade entering the `else if (numeric_grade >= 80)` branch must be less than 90. By adding explicit upper bounds like `<= 89`, the student is introducing redundant checks that work only by coincidence. This suggests a misunderstanding of control flow and the semantics of if-else chains, revealing a mental model where each condition must independently validate the entire range rather than relying on cumulative elimination.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output for most inputs, but the logic is fragile. For example, if the problem were modified to have different boundaries, the hardcoded upper bounds would need to be manually adjusted. More critically, this approach does not scale and indicates the student does not understand how to leverage control flow for range checking.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student's mental model treats each condition as independent validation logic that must prove the grade falls within a specific interval. In reality, the else-if chain creates a decision tree where earlier conditions eliminate portions of the input space. By the time execution reaches `else if (numeric_grade >= 80)`, all values >= 90 have been ruled out. The student has not internalized that control flow structure provides implicit bounds, and has instead adopted a defensive programming mindset where bounds must always be explicit\u2014a valid practice in some contexts, but unnecessary and conceptually confused here.",
