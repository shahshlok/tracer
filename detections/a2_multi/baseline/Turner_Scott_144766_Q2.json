          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when invalid input is encountered, consuming it with scanner.next() and then continuing the loop will allow the program to proceed normally on the next iteration. They think that reading the bad input once will 'clear' it from the scanner and the loop will naturally ask for input again.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands the control flow when invalid input is encountered. When scanner.hasNextInt() returns false, the scanner's internal state is positioned at the invalid token. Calling scanner.next() consumes that single token, but then the loop immediately continues back to the top. On the next iteration, it prints the prompt again and checks hasNextInt() again. However, if the user never enters a valid integer after the invalid input, the program enters an infinite loop of consuming one token per iteration and reprinting the prompt. The student appears to believe that consuming the bad input solves the problem, when in reality it doesn't advance past the problematic input stream state if the user keeps entering non-integers. The correct approach would be to consume the entire invalid line (e.g., scanner.nextLine()) or to handle the error more robustly.",
          "error_manifestation": "If a user enters non-integer input (like 'abc'), the program will enter an infinite loop, continuously printing 'Guess a number (1-100): ' without waiting for new input or making progress. The user sees repeated prompts without their input being requested, creating the appearance of a hung program.",

If a user enters 'abc' followed by a newline, scanner.next() consumes 'abc' but leaves the newline in the buffer.
