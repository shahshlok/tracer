For example, they think 85/10 will give them a value that accurately represents an 'B grade' student, not realizing that integer division truncates to 4 when the expected behavior for their logic should distinguish between 80-89 range.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to understand that integer division in Java truncates toward zero. When dividing 85 by 10, the result is 8 (not 8.5). While this happens to work for the range 80-89 (giving a=8 when n is 80-89), the approach is fundamentally flawed because it only works by coincidence for this particular problem. The student's mental model suggests they think 85/10 should somehow capture the 'tens place' meaningfully, but they haven't considered edge cases or verified the logic across all ranges. For example, a grade of 95 gives a=9, which correctly maps to 'A', but a grade of 59 gives a=5, which correctly maps to 'F'\u2014so while the code works, the student's reasoning about WHY it works is incomplete.",

Specifically, they think that checking if a>=9 will catch 'A' grades (90-100), a==8 catches 'B' (80-89), etc. However, the student hasn't carefully verified that a grade of 100 divided by 10 equals 10, not 9.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The code has a critical flaw: a grade of 100 would result in a=10, which does NOT satisfy the condition a>=9 in the way the student expects. Actually, a>=9 is true when a is 9 or 10, so it does catch 100. However, more significantly, the student's approach of using integer division to extract the tens digit assumes single-digit results, but 100/10=10. The actual boundary conditions are: grades 0-59 should map to values 0-5, grades 60-69 to 6, 70-79 to 7, 80-89 to 8, and 90-100 to 9-10. The condition a>=9 does work for 90-100 because both 9 and 10 are >=9. The logic accidentally works, but the student may not have explicitly reasoned through the edge case of 100.",
