They likely view the '=' operator as a definition of a specific state rather than a command to evaluate and update a memory location in one step.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's notional machine, expressions (like 'x + 1' or 'x % 2') are evaluated to a single value that can be directly used as an operand for another operator or as a condition. There is no requirement to 'box' intermediate values into named variables. Furthermore, the assignment operator '=' evaluates the entire right-hand side before updating the variable on the left, meaning 'x = x + 1' is a safe and standard operation.",
