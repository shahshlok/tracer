They think that checking `numeric_grade >= a && numeric_grade <= 100` for grade A, `numeric_grade >= b && numeric_grade <= 89` for grade B, etc., will correctly partition the input space into the five required ranges.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has not recognized that the upper bounds in their conditions are hardcoded constants rather than being derived from the logical structure of the ranges. While this particular set of hardcoded values happens to work for grades 0-100, it represents a misunderstanding of how to design conditional logic for mutually exclusive ranges. The student treats each condition as independent, with explicit upper bounds, rather than understanding that once a grade fails the 'A' check (numeric_grade < 90), any subsequent check for 'B' should only need to verify the lower bound (>= 80), since the upper bound is implicitly established by the previous condition's failure. The mental model suggests the student believes each condition must independently verify both boundaries, rather than understanding the sequential nature of if-else chains.",
          "error_manifestation": "While the code produces correct output for the sample input (85 \u2192 B), this is due to the hardcoded boundaries accidentally aligning with the problem requirements. The code is brittle and demonstrates incomplete understanding of conditional logic structure.",
