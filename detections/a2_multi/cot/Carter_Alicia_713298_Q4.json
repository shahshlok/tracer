          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that computing `c = b - a + 1` (with `a=1`, `b=N`) gives the correct *ending value* for the outer loop to produce N rows, so looping `row` from `a` to `c` will print 1..N stars.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `for (row = a; row <= c; row++)` executes exactly `(c - a + 1)` iterations. With `a=1` and `c = N`, that produces N iterations. But the transformation `c = b - a + 1` only works here because `a` is 1; it is not generally a correct way to compute a loop\u2019s ending value. The student\u2019s approach suggests confusion between (1) an inclusive upper bound value and (2) the count of iterations/rows. In general, if `a` changed (e.g., `a=0`), this formula would no longer match the intended number of rows.",
          "error_manifestation": "No error for typical inputs in this exact program (output matches expected). However, the logic is fragile and would produce the wrong number of rows if the start value `a` were changed or if the student later reused the pattern with different bounds.",
