Any code remaining in the loop body (like incrementing 'guesses' or calculating 'diff') will still execute to completion even if the condition has logically become false during the body's execution.",
          "error_manifestation": "In this specific code, the misconception is 'masked' because the student's logic handles the case where diff is 0 by doing nothing inside the if/else-if block. However, if they had placed an 'else' block for feedback, it would have executed on the final correct guess, potentially surprising the student.",
