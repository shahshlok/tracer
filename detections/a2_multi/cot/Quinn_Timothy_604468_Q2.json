The `finalCount` copy and the `finalCount != 0` guard do not affect correctness; they indicate confusion about whether variables persist after loops and about which paths can reach the final print.\n\n(Trace summary establishing this)\n- Initial state: `guess_count = 0`, `done = false`.\n- Each iteration with a valid integer input executes `guess_count = guess_count + 1` before any possibility of `done = true`.\n- The only assignment that can make `done = true` is `if (userGuess == answer) done = true;`, which occurs only after at least one valid integer guess has been read and counted.\n- Therefore, if the loop ever ends, `guess_count >= 1`, and `guess_count` is still available for printing without copying.",
