          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the `for` loop bound `i <= c` is interpreted literally: it will iterate from `a` to `c` inclusive. When `a = 1` and `b = N`, `c = b - a + 1` evaluates to `N`, so it happens to work, but only because `a` is 1. If `a` changed, `c` would no longer equal the intended maximum star count / intended last row size. The student is conflating 'count of rows' (how many iterations) with 'final value of the loop variable' (the last i). Correct reasoning is either (1) iterate `i` from 1 to N, or (2) iterate `i` from 0 to N-1 and print `i+1` stars\u2014without introducing a bound computed as a count but used as a terminal value.",
