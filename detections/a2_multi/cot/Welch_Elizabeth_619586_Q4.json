While the code does work correctly because multiplying by 1 is identity, it suggests the student doesn't fully understand that i itself directly represents the count needed for each row. The student seems to believe they need to construct the count through intermediate variable assignments and multiplication, rather than recognizing that the loop variable i already provides the required value.",
