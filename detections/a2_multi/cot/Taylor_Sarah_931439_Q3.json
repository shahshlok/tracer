          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that each grade range needs explicit upper bound checks in the if-else conditions. They think that writing `grade >= b && grade <= 89` is necessary to ensure the value stays within the B range (80-89), even though they've already checked that it's not in the A range (90-100) via the previous condition.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not fully understand that once a condition fails in an if-else chain, subsequent conditions only need to check the lower bound of their range. Since the A condition (grade >= 90) already filtered out grades 90-100, the B condition only needs to verify grade >= 80; the upper bound of 89 is redundant and creates a logical inconsistency. The hardcoded constants (b = 80, c = 70, d = 60) are used in comparisons, but the upper bounds (89, 79, 69) are hardcoded inline, leading to maintenance issues and the misconception that both bounds must be explicitly specified for correctness.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output for most inputs, but the student's logic reveals a misunderstanding of how if-else chains work. The redundant upper bound checks don't cause runtime errors, but they demonstrate that the student believes all range boundaries must be explicitly coded rather than relying on the control flow of conditional statements.",
