          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, code after a while-loop executes whenever the loop condition becomes false (here, when user_guess == answer). That is correct for this program. However, if the student thought the program should announce correctness immediately inside the loop (or feared it might print at the wrong time), they may not understand that the loop condition is checked at the top of each iteration and that exiting the loop implies the condition is false. In other words, the correctness announcement after the loop is not 'special'\u2014it's just sequential execution after the loop terminates.",
