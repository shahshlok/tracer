The problem explicitly states the input will be a numeric grade (0-100), so the clamping is defensive programming that adds no value. More importantly, the student may believe that without these checks, the subsequent if-else chain would fail or produce incorrect results. In reality, if the input is guaranteed to be 0-100 as per the problem, these checks are redundant. Additionally, the nested if statement at lines 27-29 (checking 'if (temp_grade < 60)' inside the final else block) is logically unnecessary since reaching that else block already guarantees the condition is true.",
