          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, variables are best declared in the narrowest scope possible (e.g., within the for-loop header). The student's mental model treats variable declaration as a separate mandatory setup phase at the start of the program, which is a legacy of older programming languages. This leads to redundant initializations (since the loop header resets 'a' and 'b' anyway) and the presence of unused variables like 'c'.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code contains dead code (unused variable 'c') and redundant initialization statements. While the program produces the correct output, this pattern shows a lack of understanding regarding variable scope and the functionality of the for-loop's initialization expression.",
