Therefore, if 'numeric_grade >= 90' is false, the 'else' branch automatically knows that the grade is less than 90.

Specifically, by over-constraining the ranges (e.g., 'numeric_grade <= 100' for an 'A'), any input above 100 (like 105) will fail all specific checks and fall into the final 'else' block, resulting in an incorrect 'F' grade.",
