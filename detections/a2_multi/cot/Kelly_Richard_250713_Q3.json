The student appears to believe that conditions must be explicitly re-verified even after they have been logically exhausted by prior conditions.",

The problem statement implies grades should be in the 0-100 range, but the code's approach of clamping out-of-range values (setting <0 to 0, >100 to 100) changes the specification\u2014the problem doesn't ask for clamping, just grade classification.
