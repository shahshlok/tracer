Writing `i++` in the inner loop increments the *outer loop* variable `i`, not `j`. Since `i` controls both (1) the inner-loop condition `j <= i` and (2) the outer-loop progression, modifying `i` inside the inner loop causes `i` to grow during printing, preventing the inner loop from terminating (because `i` keeps increasing while `j` stays 1). This results in an effectively infinite print of `*` and the program never reaches the expected newline/row structure.",

This means: (1) the variable `j` never changes, so the condition `j<=i` remains constant after the first check, and (2) the variable `i` (which controls the outer loop) gets incremented during the inner loop, causing the outer loop to skip rows and eventually terminate prematurely.
