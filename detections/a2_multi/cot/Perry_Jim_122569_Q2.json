A `while` loop stops only when its condition becomes false at the next loop-condition check, or when control flow is explicitly redirected with statements like `break`, `return`, or an exception. In this code, the loop ends not because of the print, but because `userGuessValue` has been updated to equal `secretRandomNumber`, making the `while (userGuessValue != secretRandomNumber)` condition false on the next check.",
