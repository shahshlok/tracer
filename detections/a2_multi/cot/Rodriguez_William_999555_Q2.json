          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the termination of a loop requires an explicit conditional branch (the 'else' statement) within the loop body to handle the final state (the correct guess), rather than trusting the loop's condition to manage the exit and handling the final state after the loop.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java execution model, a while-loop completes its entire body before re-evaluating the condition. The student's use of an 'else' block inside the loop to print the 'Correct!' message is logically redundant because the loop header (userGuess != answer) already guards for this condition. A more streamlined model would place the success message after the loop.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program performs an unnecessary equality check: once at the top of the loop (as the negative !=) and once at the bottom (as the implicit 'else' for the < and > checks).",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student recognizes that 'userGuess' must be initialized to enter the loop, but they do not use a 'do-while' loop, which is specifically designed for scenarios where the body should execute at least once before the condition is checked. This results in a dependency on a hard-coded 'dummy' value (0) that happens to be outside the random range (1-100).",
