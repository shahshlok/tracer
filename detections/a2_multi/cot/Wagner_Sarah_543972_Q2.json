          "conceptual_gap": "The student is using a 'pre-test' loop (while) to model a process that is naturally 'post-test' (user input must happen before the guess can be checked). This results in a mental model where the computer's initial check of the loop condition is a hurdle that must be 'tricked' using a dummy value (0). While syntactically correct in Java, this relies on a fragile assumption that the dummy value (0) will never be the same as the randomly generated secret number (which is 1-100).",
          "error_manifestation": "No error in this specific instance, but the logic would fail if the random number range included the dummy value (e.g., if the game allowed 0 as a secret number).",
