They also believe input is read each loop iteration and that the program terminates once the guess equals the secret number.",
          "conceptual_gap": "No gap found: the code correctly implements the intended number guessing game. The random-number range math is correct, `guessCount` increments correctly, the loop terminates correctly, and outputs match the specification (Too low/Too high/Correct with count).",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the while loop condition (guess != secret_number) acts like a trigger that should stop the program as soon as it becomes false. However, because they want to display a 'Correct!' message and the final count precisely when the game ends, they include the 'Correct!' logic inside an else-block within the loop to ensure it is caught before the loop terminates.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a 'while' loop is a guard-based structure where the condition is only evaluated at the start of each iteration. The student's model treats the loop body as a sequence that includes the final success state, rather than seeing the loop as a structure that only handles the 'incorrect guess' phase, which would logically lead to the success message being placed after the loop.",
          "error_manifestation": "The student produces functional code by using an if-else-if-else ladder to handle the 'Correct' state as a special case within the loop body. While correct in this instance, this mental model often leads to bugs where code intended for 'after the loop' is incorrectly placed inside, or redundant checks are made.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student understands that local variables must be initialized in Java, but they rely on a 'sentinel value' approach to bypass the loop's entry guard. They may not be aware of the 'do-while' construct, which is designed to execute the body once before checking the condition, thus removing the need for a dummy value.",
          "error_manifestation": "This manifests as the unnecessary initialization of 'guess = 0' on line 18, which is purely a mechanical fix to satisfy the loop's entry condition.",
