          "student_thought_process": "The student believes the loop will stop immediately when the guess becomes correct, so the 'Correct!' message is either unnecessary inside the loop or might not run unless placed after the loop. They may be uncertain whether the loop condition is checked before or after the loop body executes.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a `while` loop checks its condition before each iteration, but once inside an iteration, the body runs to completion unless you `break`/`return`. This code correctly prints 'Correct!' in the `else` branch and then exits on the next condition check (since `userGuess == answer`). If the student expects immediate termination mid-iteration, they misunderstand that the loop condition is not re-checked until the end of the iteration.",
          "error_manifestation": "No functional error in this submission; the program behaves correctly. The misconception would typically manifest as placing the 'Correct!' print after the loop without ensuring the loop ends appropriately, or omitting the `else` and expecting the loop condition alone to handle the success message.",
