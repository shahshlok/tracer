          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that each condition in an if-else chain is independent relative to its range boundaries. The condition `numeric_grade >= b` (where b=80) will be true for ANY grade >= 80, including 90, 95, and 100. Without an upper bound check like `numeric_grade < 90`, grades in the 90-100 range that pass the first condition will never reach the second condition, but if they did, they would incorrectly match the B condition. The if-else structure prevents the B condition from being evaluated for grades >= 90, so this particular code works correctly by accident. However, the student's mental model is flawed: they don't understand that ranges require BOTH a lower and upper bound to be properly specified.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While the if-else structure does prevent grades >= 90 from matching the B, C, D conditions (because the first condition catches them), the student's code shows inconsistent logic. The first condition explicitly checks `numeric_grade <= 100`, but the subsequent conditions do not check upper bounds. This reveals a misunderstanding: either the student thinks ranges don't need upper bounds for non-first conditions, or they haven't thought through the complete logic. In reality, for clarity and correctness, each range should be fully specified with both bounds, even though the if-else ordering can mask the omission in this specific case.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's if-else-if structure, a branch is executed if its boolean condition is true and all preceding conditions in the chain were false. By explicitly adding an upper bound to the 'A' grade condition (numeric_grade <= 100), the student allows values greater than 100 to evaluate to 'false' for the first block. The execution then proceeds to the 'else if (numeric_grade >= b)' block. Since a value like 105 is greater than or equal to 80 (the value of 'b'), it satisfies the condition, causing the program to incorrectly assign a 'B' grade to a score of 105.
