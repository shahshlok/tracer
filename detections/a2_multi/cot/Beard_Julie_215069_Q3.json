While an integer works for the sample run, a 'numeric grade' in many educational contexts can be a decimal (e.g., 85.5). In Java, 'nextInt()' will throw an 'InputMismatchException' if it encounters a decimal point, revealing a gap in understanding data type precision and input robustess.",

However, the Java notional machine evaluates boolean expressions (like 'n >= 90') in isolation. Without explicit bounds-checking or validation logic, the program will produce logically questionable results for values like 110 (result: A) or negative numbers (result: F), which may not align with the strict 0-100 specification.",
