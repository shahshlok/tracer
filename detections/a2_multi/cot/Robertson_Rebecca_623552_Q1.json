They think each if statement acts as an iteration point.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has not grasped that if statements are one-time conditional executions, not iterative structures. Each if block executes at most once based on its condition at that moment. The code does execute 5 times total (once per if block), but the student's mental model conflates this with an actual loop mechanism like `while` or `for`. The code happens to work for this specific case because there are exactly 5 if statements, making the solution appear correct for the sample input. However, this approach is brittle and doesn't scale: if the requirement changed to read 10 integers, the code wouldn't work without adding more if statements. The student doesn't understand that the repetition comes from loop constructs, not from writing multiple similar code blocks.",
