The student does not recognize that these are simply redundant intermediate variables that add complexity without improving functionality.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has created aliases for simple values (a for 0, b for N, c for -1) rather than using them directly in the loop and assignment. While this is not strictly incorrect in Java, it demonstrates a misunderstanding about variable necessity and code clarity. The code works correctly despite this practice, but the student appears to believe these intermediate variables serve a purpose when they simply obscure the straightforward logic.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error or incorrect output occurs; the code produces the correct result.

In Java, the loop variable `i` could be declared within the for-loop itself (for (int i = 0; ...) without the external declaration. The student appears to believe `i` must be declared outside the loop, possibly conflating Java's scoping rules with those of other languages or older Java conventions.",
