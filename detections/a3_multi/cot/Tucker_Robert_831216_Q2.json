          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, array elements (e.g., `arr[i]`) can be treated exactly like individual variables for comparison and assignment. The student creates redundant copies `a` and `b`, and even a third redundant variable `temporaryScore`, instead of utilizing the fact that `a` is already a temporary storage of the value at `innerLoopIndex`.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code is functionally correct but contains redundant variable assignments and memory usage. This mental model often leads to bugs where students expect the local copies (`a` or `b`) to automatically update the array if they are changed, or vice versa.",
