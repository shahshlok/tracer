Consequently, they include a redundant guard 'if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)' to ensure that the variable is only set once, fearing that the loop might continue and overwrite the result with subsequent matches despite the 'break'.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the 'break' statement is designed specifically to terminate the innermost enclosing loop or switch statement immediately. It does not apply to 'if' statements. Because the student's 'break' is inside the 'if (currentArrayValue == targetValueToFind)' block, the first match will stop the entire 'while' loop. This makes the inner guard 'if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)' logically redundant, as that code path can only ever be reached once before the loop is terminated.",
