          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, a variable's value can be assigned to any variable currently in scope. A variable declared within a 'for' loop header (as seen in the student's first loop at line 9) is perfectly capable of having its value assigned to an outer-scope variable (like 'z') during the loop's execution. The scope of the variable 'i' only affects its own visibility, not the ability to copy its value to another variable.",
