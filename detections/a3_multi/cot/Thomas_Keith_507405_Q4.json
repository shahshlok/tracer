They likely believe this is necessary for the values to remain stable or that Java requires single-variable operands in loop headers rather than expressions.",

There is no need to capture a value in a new variable unless the original value will change and you need the previous state. Literals (like 0) and expressions (like N-1) are first-class citizens in control flow headers.",
