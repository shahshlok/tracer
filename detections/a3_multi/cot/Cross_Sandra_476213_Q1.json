          "conceptual_gap": "In typical introductory array problems, N is assumed to be non-negative (often strictly positive) per the problem statement. While Java would throw a NegativeArraySizeException if you used a negative N to allocate an array, the spec for this task usually expects input validation or simply assumes valid input. The student's adjustment changes the semantics: an invalid N no longer causes an error or reprompt; it produces an empty array and will always output -1. This is not a Java execution misconception so much as an input-contract misconception about what cases must be handled.",
          "error_manifestation": "Usually no error; program still produces correct results for valid inputs. For invalid negative N, it changes the problem behavior (outputs -1 rather than rejecting/reprompting).",
