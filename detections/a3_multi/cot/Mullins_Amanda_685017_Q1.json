          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's execution model, a variable is a container for a value, and that value (including -1) can be used consistently in expressions like string concatenation. The student's mental model treats the 'not found' case as a unique execution event that must be 'caught' and handled with hardcoded strings rather than utilizing the variable's existing state through unified data flow.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code contains redundant conditional branching (if-else) where both paths produce functionally identical output strings, as the variable already contains the value being hardcoded in the 'if' branch.",
