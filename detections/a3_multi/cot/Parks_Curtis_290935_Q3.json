          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `String.toUpperCase()` and `String.replace(...)` return a non-null `String` when invoked on a non-null receiver. These methods do not return null under normal circumstances. The real null risk is calling a method on a null reference (e.g., `x.toUpperCase()` when `x` is null), which would throw a `NullPointerException`. Also, `Scanner.nextLine()` does not return null in typical interactive console usage; it returns an empty string for an empty line, or may throw `NoSuchElementException` if input is exhausted. Therefore, these null checks are unnecessary and do not address the actual failure mode (calling methods on null).",
