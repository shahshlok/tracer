Instead of using 'a' to perform the swap (e.g., 'int tempScore = a'), they re-access the array element ('int tempScore = scores[j]'). This suggests a mental model where the array is the only 'source of truth' for the data, and variables are only for temporary observation rather than being valid aliases for those values in all contexts.",
