Whether that value represents a valid array index (0, 1, 2...) or a sentinel error code (-1), the computer treats it as a piece of data that can be evaluated and concatenated into a string in the exact same manner. There is no fundamental distinction at the machine level between a 'success' value and a 'failure' value.",
