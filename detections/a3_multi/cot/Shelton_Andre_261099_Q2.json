Furthermore, they believe that these scalar variables 'a' and 'b' are transient proxies used only to satisfy the syntax of the conditional, rather than independent copies of the data that can be reused in the swap logic.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, an array access like 'scores[j]' is an expression that evaluates to a value. This value can be used directly in any context where an integer is expected, including boolean comparisons and assignments. The student fails to realize that 'int a = scores[j]' creates a local copy of the value that remains valid throughout the scope, rendering subsequent array reads (like 'int tempScore = scores[j]') redundant.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code is more verbose and computationally inefficient due to redundant array access operations. Specifically, the student fetches the same values from the array multiple times (lines 25 and 28) because they don't trust or realize that the scalar variables 'a' and 'b' already hold those values.",

Instead of using 'a' to perform the swap (e.g., 'scores[j+1] = a'), they re-access the array index. This suggests a mental model where variables used for logic (if-statements) are viewed as separate 'snapshots' rather than usable aliases for the data.",
