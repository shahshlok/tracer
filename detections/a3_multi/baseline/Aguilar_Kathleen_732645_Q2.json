If `a` and `b` are far apart (near `Integer.MIN_VALUE` / `Integer.MAX_VALUE`), `a - b` can overflow and flip sign, causing incorrect comparisons and therefore an incorrectly sorted array. The safe comparison is `if (scores[j] > scores[j+1])` or `Integer.compare(a, b)`. In typical CS1 score ranges (e.g., 0\u2013100), this won\u2019t show up, but it is still a real logic pitfall rooted in an incorrect mental model that subtraction always preserves ordering.",
