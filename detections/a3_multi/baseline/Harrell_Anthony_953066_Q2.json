However, the problem asks to sort in ascending order (which the code does) but then print the highest score. While the code's logic is mechanically sound\u2014sorting ascending and taking the last element does yield the maximum\u2014the student may not fully understand why this works or may have misread the problem. More critically, there is no conceptual gap in the execution model itself; the code will produce the correct output. The student's approach is valid and demonstrates proper understanding of parallel array manipulation during sorting.",
