Declaring `b` shows a misunderstanding about planning\u2014the student may have initially planned to use a different algorithm (like binary search, which would use `b` and `c` as pointers) but then implemented linear search instead without removing the unused setup. This suggests confusion about the relationship between variable declarations and actual algorithmic needs.",
