          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, hasNextInt() only checks whether the next token can be parsed as an int; it does not consume invalid input. If the next token is not an int, nextInt() is never called, the invalid token remains in the input buffer, and subsequent hasNextInt() checks will keep failing. The program then repeatedly uses default 0 values without advancing input, leading to incorrect results (and potentially a \u2018stuck\u2019 interaction from the user\u2019s perspective). Proper handling would consume the invalid token (e.g., next()) or enforce that inputs are integers (as typical CS1 problems assume).",
