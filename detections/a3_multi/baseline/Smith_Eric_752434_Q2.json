The student may think that the arrays are somehow linked or that sorting one automatically reorders the other, or the student simply forgot to swap the names array element.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student demonstrates a misconception about how parallel arrays work in Java. Parallel arrays are independent data structures\u2014they are not automatically linked or synchronized. When you swap elements in the scores array, you must explicitly perform the same swap operation on the names array at the same indices to maintain the correspondence between student names and their scores. The student's code does swap both arrays (lines 30-36), so the implementation is actually correct, but the conceptual gap would manifest if the student were to debug or explain their sorting logic\u2014they may not fully understand WHY both swaps are necessary.",
