          "conceptual_gap": "The student has implemented a nested loop structure for bubble sort, but the outer loop variable `i` is declared and incremented but never actually used in the inner loop logic. The bubble sort requires the inner loop to shrink its range with each pass (typically `n-i-1` for the upper bound on `j`), but this code uses a fixed `n-1` regardless of the outer loop iteration. This means only one complete pass of comparisons occurs before checking the final element. The misconception is that the outer loop's existence guarantees proper sorting behavior, when in fact the loop structure doesn't properly implement the bubble sort algorithm.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While the code does contain nested loops suggesting an attempt at bubble sort, the algorithm as written is incomplete. A proper bubble sort should reduce the comparison range after each pass to avoid unnecessary comparisons and ensure correctness. The student's implementation doesn't account for the fact that with a fixed inner loop boundary, not all elements will be properly repositioned relative to each other. This leads to unsorted data being treated as sorted, which is a misconception about what constitutes a complete sorting pass.",
