          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that array elements must be extracted into local variables before they can be evaluated in a comparison operator (like '>'). They also believe that even when a value is already stored in a local variable, a third temporary variable is required to perform a swap, rather than using the existing local copies.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, array access expressions (like 'z[j]') evaluate directly to values and can be used in comparisons without being assigned to variables. Furthermore, a local variable capturing an array element already acts as temporary storage, making a second 'temp' variable for the same value redundant during a swap.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code contains unnecessary variable assignments and redundant storage operations, although the final output remains logically correct.",
