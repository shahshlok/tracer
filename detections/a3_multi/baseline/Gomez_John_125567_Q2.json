Silently changing a negative N to 0 changes the meaning of the input and skips required reads, producing output that doesn\u2019t match the specification (there is no defined 'Top student' when N<=0; better handling would be to re-prompt or reject input). This reflects a shaky model of how input constraints should be enforced vs. transformed.",
