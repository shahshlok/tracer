However, the student has written the outer loop to run n times (from i=0 to i<n), which is excessive and inefficient, though it may still produce correct results in this case due to the nature of bubble sort stabilizing after multiple passes.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the nested loop structure itself is not fundamentally wrong for bubble sort, the outer loop running exactly n iterations is redundant. Bubble sort only needs at most n-1 passes to guarantee a fully sorted array, not n passes. More critically, the student may not understand that the outer loop counter `i` is declared but never used in the inner loop condition (j<n-1 is fixed). This suggests the student copied a bubble sort template without fully understanding why the loops have their specific ranges. The mental model shows mechanical application of a pattern rather than understanding the algorithm's correctness requirements.",

The student does not recognize that an early termination optimization is missing\u2014specifically, when a pass through the array results in no swaps, the array is already sorted and the algorithm should stop.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's mental model of bubble sort is partially correct but incomplete. While the implementation will eventually produce a sorted array, it lacks the optimization that checks whether any swaps occurred in a pass. A proper understanding of bubble sort includes recognizing that after each complete pass, if no swaps were made, the array is fully sorted. The missing `swapped` flag or equivalent mechanism suggests the student learned a memorized version of bubble sort without grasping the underlying principle: bubble sort can terminate early when the list becomes sorted.",
