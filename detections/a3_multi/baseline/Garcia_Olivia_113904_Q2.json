When you sort only the `scores` array, you break the correspondence between the `names` and `scores` arrays at each index. The indices no longer pair the correct name with the correct score. To maintain the relationship, you must either: (1) sort both arrays in parallel using a custom comparator or manual swapping, or (2) use a data structure that keeps name-score pairs together (like an array of objects or a single sorted structure).
