          "conceptual_gap": "The student has created unnecessary indirection by assigning a=0 and b=N, then using these in the loop condition. While this doesn't break the code functionally, it suggests the student may not fully understand that loop variables and array bounds are direct concepts\u2014not things that require intermediate representation. This could indicate confusion about variable scope, aliasing, or the purpose of variables in control flow.",
