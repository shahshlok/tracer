A correct bubble sort requires the outer loop to run n times to guarantee all elements are in their final sorted positions. This code's outer loop runs n times, but the logic is incorrect: it should continue the inner loop for the entire remaining unsorted portion on each pass. More critically, the student appears to misunderstand that a single pass through comparisons is insufficient. The code structure suggests they believe one outer iteration will sort the array, when in reality, bubble sort requires multiple complete passes.
