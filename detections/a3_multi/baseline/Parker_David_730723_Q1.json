Specifically, the student thinks that assigning N to size_holder, then checking if size_holder < 0 (and setting it to 0) is a required pattern, even though N was just read. Similarly, the student creates tmp_index from index_holder and checks if tmp_index >= 0 before using it, even though index_holder is guaranteed to be non-negative by the loop condition. The student also creates target_holder from T without any transformative purpose.",

The unnecessary intermediate variables suggest the student believes each holder variable needs to be independently validated, or that creating aliases provides some form of safety or clarity. Additionally, the student doesn't recognize that loop-controlled variables with known bounds don't require defensive checks inside the loop body. The misconception reveals a lack of understanding that once a value is validated or constrained by control flow, it doesn't need re-validation in every use.",

The student doesn't understand or prefer using break statements, which are the idiomatic way to exit loops early. More fundamentally, the student seems to think that manipulating the loop variable itself is the primary or only way to control loop flow, rather than using dedicated control flow statements.
