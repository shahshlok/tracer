However, the student has not correctly reasoned through what a negative difference means in the context of sorting.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student computes c = b - a and swaps when c < 0 (i.e., when b < a). This is correct for ascending order bubble sort. However, the problem asks to sort in ascending order but then retrieve the student with the HIGHEST score, which should be at the END of an ascending-sorted array. The student correctly implements ascending sort and correctly retrieves the last element, so this appears sound. Upon closer inspection, the logic is actually correct: if scores[j] > scores[j+1] (making c negative), they swap. After sorting in ascending order, the highest score IS at index N-1. The code logic is actually correct for the intended behavior, but the student may have arrived at the correct implementation through unclear reasoning about what the comparison means.",
