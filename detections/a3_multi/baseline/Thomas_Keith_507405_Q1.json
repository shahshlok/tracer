          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using explicit variable assignments (a = 0, b = N - 1) for loop boundaries is necessary or beneficial, and they treat these as required setup steps rather than understanding that loop indices can be directly initialized with literal values.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't fully grasp that loop control variables (like i in a for loop) are independent of array boundary values. The pattern of extracting bounds into separate variables (a and b) suggests the student may be trying to mirror patterns from other algorithms (like binary search) without understanding when this is appropriate. In a simple linear search, this adds unnecessary complexity and suggests incomplete understanding of loop mechanics.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output, but the unnecessary variable assignments and the seemingly ritualistic extraction of loop bounds indicate a misconception about loop structure. This doesn't cause a bug here, but it suggests the student may struggle with adapting loop patterns to different problems.",

This suggests a misunderstanding of how expressions work in Java\u2014specifically that array access returns a value that can be immediately used in comparisons. The pattern of extracting into x_i before comparison indicates the student may think values need to be 'stored' before they can be 'used'.",
