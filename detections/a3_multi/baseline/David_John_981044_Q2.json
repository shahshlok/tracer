While this doesn't break the correctness of bubble sort (multiple complete passes will eventually sort the array), it reveals a misunderstanding about the minimum number of passes needed. The student may believe that you always need `n` complete passes regardless of when the array becomes sorted, rather than understanding that bubble sort can terminate early or that `n-1` passes are sufficient.
