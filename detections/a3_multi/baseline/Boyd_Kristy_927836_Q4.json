          "conceptual_gap": "The problem statement implies N is the number of integers to be read; typically N is assumed to be non-negative, or the program should re-prompt/validate input. Silently changing a negative N to 0 changes the meaning of the user\u2019s input and can cause the program to skip reading elements the user might still provide. This is not a Java execution misconception, but a conceptual misunderstanding of input validation/spec requirements.",
