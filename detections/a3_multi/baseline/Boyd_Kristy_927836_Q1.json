          "conceptual_gap": "The problem statement defines N as the size of the array to be read; it implicitly assumes a valid non-negative size is provided. Silently changing the input changes the meaning of the input and can lead to behavior that no longer corresponds to the specified task (e.g., ignoring elements and searching an empty array). This is not a Java execution issue per se, but it reflects a misunderstanding about adhering to problem constraints vs. inventing new behavior.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that once the target is found, they need to explicitly set a flag variable (found = 1) and then check this flag on every subsequent iteration to prevent further processing. They think the loop won't stop naturally and they must manually control when to stop searching.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't recognize that once `index` is assigned the correct value, the loop could simply break or continue without harm. While the current logic works correctly, it reveals a misconception about loop control: the student believes they need an external flag to manage loop behavior rather than understanding that the loop will complete anyway and the first assignment to `index` determines the final result. The mental model lacks understanding of how break statements work or that redundant assignments to the same variable don't change the outcome.",
          "error_manifestation": "No incorrect output for this specific problem, but the code is inefficient and suggests the student doesn't fully understand that they could break early or that multiple redundant checks are unnecessary.",
