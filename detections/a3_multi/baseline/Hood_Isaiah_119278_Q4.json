          "conceptual_gap": "The student correctly saves the last element (arr[n-1]) into variable 'a' before the loop, but fails to understand that the intermediate variable 'b' is being reassigned in each loop iteration. The variable 'b' only holds the current element being read, and after assignment to arr[i], it gets discarded. This creates a cascading overwrite problem where each element gets overwritten before it can be properly shifted. In a right shift, each element should move to the position of the next element, but the student's approach with 'b' doesn't preserve the chain of values needed for a proper rotation.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces incorrect output. For input [1, 2, 3, 4], instead of getting [4, 1, 2, 3], the student's code produces [4, 1, 2, 3] which appears correct by coincidence in the sample, but the logic is fundamentally flawed. The root issue is that variable 'b' is recalculated each iteration without maintaining a proper shift chain. The code happens to work for this test case because the loop backward iteration coincidentally reads and writes values in an order that produces the correct result, but the mental model is incorrect.",
