Consequently, they use an additional check 'if (firstOccurrenceIndex == -1)' to ensure that the variable is not overwritten by subsequent matches if the loop continues.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the break statement immediately terminates the innermost enclosing loop (while, for, or do-while). It is not scoped to if-statements. Therefore, the internal guard checking if the index has already been found is logically redundant when followed by an immediate break.",
