          "conceptual_gap": "The student has introduced unnecessary intermediate variables (a, b) that serve no purpose other than to store values that are already known (0 and N-1). This suggests a misunderstanding about the relationship between loop variables and array indexing. The student could directly use `i` in the range [0, N-1] without creating redundant variable assignments. While this doesn't cause incorrect output for this specific problem, it reveals confusion about direct iteration patterns and suggests the student may be conflating this problem with binary search or other algorithms that genuinely need boundary variables.",
