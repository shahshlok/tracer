They also believe shifting should only happen when N > 0 to avoid invalid indexing.",
          "conceptual_gap": "I don\u2019t see a flawed mental model here: this matches Java\u2019s execution model. The student correctly anticipates overwriting risk (hence iterating from N-1 down to 1), correctly understands indexing (N-1 is last index), and correctly handles the empty-array case. Prompts are used only for the user, not as input parsing. No evidence of thinking variables auto-update, operators behave like math notation, or that methods mutate arguments unexpectedly.",

In their view, the program is a flat sequence of instructions where an 'if' statement can jump over lines, but the nested 'for' loop is considered to be at the same level as the 'if' itself.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's notional machine, blocks ({}) define a nested hierarchy of execution and scope. This is traditionally reflected through indentation (e.g., code inside a 'for' loop which is already inside an 'if' block should be double-indented). The student's indentation is erratic, placing the 'for' loop at the same horizontal level as the 'if' statement that contains it, and placing the closing brace for the 'if' block significantly further left than the code it encloses. This suggests they see the code as a flat list rather than a nested tree structure.",
          "error_manifestation": "While this does not cause a logic error in this specific program, this mental model often leads to scope errors in more complex code, such as attempting to access a variable declared inside a block from the outside, or failing to predict how 'else' statements associate with nested 'if' logic.",
