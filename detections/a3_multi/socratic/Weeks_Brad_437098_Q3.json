However, the variable (the reference) can be reassigned to point to a new, modified String object. The student conflates the fixed nature of the object's data with the flexibility of the variable name.",
          "error_manifestation": "While this code works correctly, the mental model leads to 'variable proliferation' (upperCaseString, finalShoutedString). This would prevent the student from using idiomatic reassignment (e.g., s = s.trim()) or using a single accumulator variable inside a loop.",
