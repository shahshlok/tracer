          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that calling a String method like toUpperCase() or replace() might directly change the original String (i.e., that Strings are mutable and updated in place).",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, String objects are immutable: methods like toUpperCase() and replace() do not modify the existing String object. They return a new String. The correct mental model is: the variable holds a reference to an immutable object; calling these methods produces a new object/reference, which you must store if you want to keep the change. This student actually stores the returned values, which suggests they may understand this\u2014but it\u2019s also common that beginners do this \u201cjust because it works\u201d without understanding the immutability reason. There\u2019s no direct evidence they hold the incorrect belief strongly, but this is the most relevant misconception to probe given the question note.",
          "error_manifestation": "Often no immediate error if they store the returned value; the misconception would manifest if they wrote `input.toUpperCase();` expecting `input` to change. In this submission, it does not manifest as an error.",
