Setting `n=0` silently skips reading elements and makes the search trivially return -1. This isn\u2019t a Java execution misunderstanding so much as a mismatch between the student\u2019s model of \u201crobust programs always auto-correct input\u201d and typical spec-driven programming where you either trust the input constraints or handle invalid input explicitly.",

Conceptually, this changes the problem instance: the program proceeds with an empty array rather than rejecting the input or re-prompting.
