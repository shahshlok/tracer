          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java notional machine, the condition in a for-loop is only evaluated at the beginning of each iteration. If there were additional statements after 'e = c' inside the loop body, they would still execute during that final iteration because the machine does not 'short-circuit' the entire loop body the moment a condition variable changes.",
          "error_manifestation": "In this specific code, it produces the correct output because the assignment is the last (and only) operation in the loop. However, this mental model leads to logical errors if a student expects subsequent code within the same block to be skipped once the search criteria are met.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that the variable 'e' already holds the exact value required for the 'not found' output. This suggests a mental model where 'data values' used for internal state and 'messages' printed to the user are distinct, even when they represent the same integer value.",
