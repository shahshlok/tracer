          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the integer variable 'n' used to define the array's size is the primary and most appropriate way to refer to the array's boundaries throughout the program.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, an array is an object that internally stores its own size in a 'length' property. The student's mental model relies on an external variable ('n') to control iterations and indexing, which indicates a view of the array as a passive container whose metadata must be manually tracked externally, rather than as an encapsulated object that 'knows' its own size. This reliance is fragile because 'n' is not synchronized with the array's memory state.",
          "error_manifestation": "In this specific program, the code executes correctly because 'n' is not modified. However, this model typically leads to 'IndexOutOfBoundsException' or logic bugs in larger systems where arrays are passed to methods without their associated size variables.",
