          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, String objects are immutable. Methods like toUpperCase() and replace() do not modify the existing String; they return a *new* String. To \u201cupdate\u201d a variable, you must assign that returned value back into a variable (often the same variable name). In this student\u2019s code, they actually do reassign correctly, which suggests they may understand this\u2014or they may have done it by pattern without a firm mental model. The key misconception to probe is whether they think reassignment is necessary and why.",
