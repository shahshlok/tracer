          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, prompts are just output text. The computer does not infer structure, validation, or meaning from them. The actual behavior is determined only by reading tokens via Scanner (e.g., nextInt()) and the control flow; if the user types unexpected input, the program may block, read the \u201cwrong\u201d token, or throw an InputMismatchException. Prompts don\u2019t enforce anything.",
          "error_manifestation": "Usually no error if user follows directions; but if user enters non-integers or the wrong number of integers, it can cause blocking (waiting for input) or runtime exceptions (InputMismatchException).",

          "conceptual_gap": "Java arrays are 0-based: the first element is at index 0. The code itself uses 0-based indexing correctly, but beginners often have a shaky mental model here; the sample output (\u201cindex: 1\u201d for value 20 at the second position) can mask confusion. A student with a 1-based mental model might accidentally print i+1 or start loops at 1 in other attempts. Here they didn\u2019t, but it\u2019s a common hidden misconception to probe.",
