Also, shifting logic can be written to naturally handle n=0 or n=1 without special-case prompts; the key is understanding what operations actually require valid indices. The student's code is correct, but the extra branching suggests they may not clearly separate \"I/O text\" from \"array index safety\" and may be uncertain about when an operation is unsafe.",
