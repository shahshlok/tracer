          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the Scanner.next() method is designed to read the next 'token' based on whitespace delimiters. If a student's name includes a space (e.g., 'Alice Smith'), next() will only capture the first part ('Alice'), leaving the remainder in the buffer. This reveals a mental model where the computer understands the semantic intent of 'reading a name' rather than the mechanical process of tokenization.",
