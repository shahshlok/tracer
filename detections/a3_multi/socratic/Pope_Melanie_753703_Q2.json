          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `Scanner.next()` reads only the next *token* (up to whitespace). So if a student enters a name with spaces (e.g., \"Mary Jane\"), `next()` would read only \"Mary\" for that array element, and \"Jane\" would be treated as the next name input. To read a whole line (including spaces), you\u2019d typically use `nextLine()`\u2014but mixing `nextInt()` and `nextLine()` also requires handling the leftover newline.",
