          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that calling methods like toUpperCase() and replace() on a String object will modify the original string in place, similar to how one might modify a list or array. The student may think that after calling upper.replace(' ', '_'), the variable 'upper' is automatically updated to contain the result of the replacement operation.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, Strings are immutable. When methods like toUpperCase() or replace() are called on a String, they do not modify the original String object. Instead, they return a NEW String object containing the modified content. The student's code actually demonstrates correct understanding by assigning the return value to a new variable (result = upper.replace(' ', '_')), but the note in the problem statement suggests the student may not fully internalize WHY this is necessary. The student appears to be following a pattern (assigning return values to variables) without necessarily understanding that this is required because the original String cannot be modified.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code runs correctly and produces the expected output, so there is no runtime error or wrong output. However, the misconception becomes apparent when considering how the student might refactor the code or explain their reasoning. If asked 'why did you create the result variable instead of just printing upper.replace(...)?', the student might not have a clear conceptual answer rooted in immutability.",
