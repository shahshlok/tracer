They believe that to perform a transformation, they must create a new variable (like 'upper' or 'result') to store the new version, rather than reassigning the original variable reference.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not distinguish between the immutability of the String object (the data in memory) and the mutability of the variable reference (the name pointing to that memory). In Java, a variable can be reassigned to point to a new String object (e.g., 'input = input.toUpperCase()') without violating the rule that the original String object itself cannot be changed.",
          "error_manifestation": "The student creates redundant intermediate variables ('upper' and 'result') for each step of the string processing, which increases memory overhead and reduces code readability compared to variable reassignment or method chaining.",
