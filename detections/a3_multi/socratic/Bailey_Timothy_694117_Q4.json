          "conceptual_gap": "While the Java compiler is indeed white-space insensitive, this mental model fails to recognize that source code represents a hierarchical structure of nested execution blocks (methods inside classes, loops inside conditionals). Treating code as a flat sequence of instructions often leads to difficulty in debugging more complex control flow logic.",
