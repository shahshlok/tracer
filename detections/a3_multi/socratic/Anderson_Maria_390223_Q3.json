The correct mental model is: method call produces a new String; you must store/use the returned value. The student\u2019s code actually demonstrates the correct approach (assigning results to new variables), but the presence of the note about immutability often leads beginners to the wrong conclusion, so it\u2019s worth checking whether they understand *why* they had to assign the results.",
