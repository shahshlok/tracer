You must store (assign) the returned String if you want to keep the change. In this student\u2019s code they *do* assign back to y, which suggests they may understand this\u2014but the task note (\u201cStrings are immutable\u201d) is exactly where many beginners assume in-place changes would happen if they forgot the assignment (e.g., y.toUpperCase();). So the only potential misconception visible here is worth probing: do they think the assignment is optional?",
