They think that each transformation of the data\u2014such as converting to uppercase or replacing characters\u2014requires the creation of a brand-new variable name to store the result, as the original variable name is perceived as being permanently tied to the original string object.",

In the Java notional machine, while a String object's content cannot change once created, the variable (the reference) is simply a pointer that can be reassigned to a new object. The student does not yet realize they can overwrite the original variable (e.g., s = s.toUpperCase()) to manage state more efficiently.",
