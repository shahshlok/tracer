Indices are just integer expressions; introducing extra variables doesn\u2019t change execution, and can sometimes hide the real idea (e.g., that the loop starts at N-1 and stops at 1).

This suggests the student may be thinking the program might somehow still do meaningful shifting on an empty array unless blocked.
