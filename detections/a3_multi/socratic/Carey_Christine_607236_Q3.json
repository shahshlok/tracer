If you don\u2019t store the returned value (in a new variable or back into the same variable), the change is lost. The student's code actually does the correct thing by capturing the returned Strings, but the structure (creating new variables for each step) suggests they may still be reasoning in a 'modify then use' mindset rather than 'create a new String each time'.",
