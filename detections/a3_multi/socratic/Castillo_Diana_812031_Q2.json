If the goal is only \u201chighest score,\u201d a linear scan suffices; sorting is an additional transformation of the data. This isn\u2019t a Java execution-model error, but it reflects a novice mental model that problems have exactly one canonical algorithm and that stated steps must be followed literally rather than reasoning about what each step accomplishes and whether it\u2019s necessary for a sub-goal.",
