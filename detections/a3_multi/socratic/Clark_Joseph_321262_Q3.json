          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, String immutability means methods like toUpperCase() and replace() do not change the original String object; they return a new String. Storing that returned value is necessary if you want to keep it\u2014but you don\u2019t have to create multiple named intermediate variables; you just need to capture the returned result somewhere (even in the same variable, or by chaining calls). The student\u2019s code is correct, but the mental model may be: \u201cimmutability forces new variables for every step,\u201d rather than: \u201cmethods return a new String; assignment decides what reference you keep.\u201d",
