They assume that if the search fails and returns -1, the output should still be formatted as 'Found at index: -1' rather than just the raw number -1 as specified in the instructions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In programming, output must adhere strictly to specified formats. The student's mental model fails to separate the 'success' output case (which requires a prefix) from the 'failure' output case (which requires a raw value). They do not realize that string literals in a print statement are executed sequentially and unconditionally unless guarded by an if-else structure.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not distinguish between the console echoing a user's newline character during input and the program explicitly controlling the output stream with System.out.println().
