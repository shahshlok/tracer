          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that storing intermediate values in temporary variables (like `currentArrayElement`) is necessary or beneficial even when those variables are only used once immediately after assignment. The student thinks that using a temporary variable to hold `userInputArray[currentIndex]` before comparing it makes the code clearer or is required by Java.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't fully grasp that temporary variables are optional optimizations or readability aids, not requirements. In Java, you can directly compare `userInputArray[currentIndex] == targetNumberT` without the intermediate step. The presence of the temporary variable `currentArrayElement` suggests the student may think each operation requires its own named storage, rather than understanding that expressions can be composed directly. This reflects a mental model where the student sees each line as a separate, isolated operation rather than part of a larger computational flow.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error or incorrect output\u2014the code works correctly. However, the pattern reveals a misconception about code structure: the student writes unnecessarily verbose code, suggesting they don't fully understand that intermediate steps can be skipped.",

          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that providing extensive, repetitive comments for every single operation is necessary to make code understandable. They comment on obvious operations like creating a Scanner, incrementing a loop counter, and simple assignments as if the code's intent is unclear without these explanations.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student hasn't internalized that good code is self-documenting through clear variable names and logical structure. While comments are valuable, excessive comments on trivial operations suggest the student feels the code itself cannot communicate intent\u2014a sign they don't yet trust variable names and program flow to be readable. This indicates a mental model where code is inherently obscure and needs English translations to be understood, rather than a model where code structure and naming conventions naturally convey meaning.",
          "error_manifestation": "No functional error. The code runs correctly. However, the excessive commenting pattern reveals an underlying belief that code needs constant verbal scaffolding, suggesting the student may struggle with code comprehension and may not yet see the computer as executing a logical sequence directly understandable from the code structure.",
