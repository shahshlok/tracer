          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that variable names must explicitly describe their role or source (e.g., 'userInputScanner' instead of just 'scanner') because the computer needs this semantic context to correctly route data from the keyboard to the array.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, identifiers are arbitrary labels for memory locations. The machine has no concept of 'user input' or 'elements' based on the names chosen. The student's mental model treats the computer as an intelligent agent that partially relies on the meaning of words to understand the data's purpose.",
          "error_manifestation": "While this code is logically correct, this belief often leads to 'Fragile Naming' syndrome, where a student becomes afraid to rename a variable for fear of breaking the connection to the physical world (like the keyboard), or they become confused when code they copy uses 'i' and 'j' instead of descriptive names.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The Java compiler strips all comments; they exist solely for humans. The student's mental model suggests they view the program as a dual-language document where the English comments help the machine 'interpret' the ambiguous logic of the code.",
          "error_manifestation": "This manifests as redundant, instructional comments for every single line. In more complex debugging, a student with this model might incorrectly assume that because a comment says a loop 'shifts elements,' the loop will inherently perform that action regardless of a logic error in the code itself.",
