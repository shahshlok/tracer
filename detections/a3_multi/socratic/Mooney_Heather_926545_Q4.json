If the specification expects N to be positive, you typically handle this by re-prompting, reporting an error, or otherwise making the behavior explicit. Silently overwriting N changes what the rest of the program means (e.g., you now allocate a 0-length array and skip reading elements), which can hide bugs and makes the program\u2019s behavior surprising. This is more about program semantics and user-input modeling than syntax.",
