Beginners often rely on the variable they used to initialize the array (in this case, 'N') for all subsequent loops and bounds checks.

Inconsistent indentation (e.g., line 23 being indented less than the for-loop on line 22, or the variable spacing in the output loop) indicates that the student is not using spatial organization to verify the nesting and scope of their logic.",
