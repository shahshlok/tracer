Introducing `int a = arr[i];` doesn\u2019t change how the program runs; it\u2019s just an extra name for the same value. Beginners sometimes do this because they think the computer needs an intermediate step to 'remember' the element or because they\u2019re mapping the code to a paper-based step-by-step procedure rather than understanding expression evaluation.",
