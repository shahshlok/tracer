          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, Strings are immutable: methods such as toUpperCase() and replace() do not modify the existing String object. Instead, they return a new String. If you don\u2019t assign the return value, the original variable still refers to the unchanged String. This code actually shows the correct mental model (capture the returned String), but it also suggests the student may be compensating for/uncertain about whether mutation happens in place because they immediately create new variables for each transformation.",
