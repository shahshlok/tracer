          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, while the compiler ignores whitespace, consistent indentation is a visual representation of the Abstract Syntax Tree (logical nesting). The student fails to associate the depth of brackets with the horizontal indentation level, leading to code that is structurally sound but visually misleading.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code contains highly inconsistent indentation (ranging from 1 space to 9 spaces) that does not align with the 'if' or 'for' blocks, which would make debugging logic errors (like misplaced brackets) extremely difficult in more complex programs.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not realize that `System.out.print` is a raw stream that only moves the cursor by the exact characters provided. They rely on the user's 'Enter' key press during the input phase to provide the vertical separation between the prompt 'Enter elements' and the output 'Shifted:', rather than explicitly controlling the cursor with `println` or `\\n`.",
          "error_manifestation": "If the input were provided via an automated script or if the user entered values without a trailing newline, the 'Shifted:' output would appear immediately on the same line as the integers, potentially making the output '1 2 3 4Shifted: 4 1 2 3'.",
