In the Java execution model, an array-access expression can be used anywhere a variable of its component type is expected, including directly inside an 'if' condition (e.g., if (scores[j] > scores[j+1])). The student's model treats the array index as a 'storage location' that must be accessed and moved to a 'working variable' before logic can be applied.",
