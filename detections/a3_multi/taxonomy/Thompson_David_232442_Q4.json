          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model evaluates expressions (like N-1) and literals (like 0 and 1) as first-class values in any context. There is no requirement or performance benefit to 'anchoring' these values to variable names. Furthermore, the student's model is inconsistent, as they use the variable 'c' for the loop boundary but use the literal '1' in the expression 'i - 1' inside the loop body.",

In Java, literals like '0' or '1' and expressions like 'N - 1' are first-class values that can be used directly in control flow; creating symbolic aliases (a, b, c) is a redundant step that suggests the student views the computer as requiring a 'translation' from numeric values into symbolic labels to process logic.",
