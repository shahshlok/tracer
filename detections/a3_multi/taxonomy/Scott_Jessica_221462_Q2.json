Specifically, they believe that if sc.hasNextInt() is false, the loop will skip to the next iteration and the Scanner will automatically 'wait' for or provide a different token for the next check, rather than remaining stuck at the invalid one.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java Scanner execution model, the cursor only advances when a 'consumption' method (like next(), nextInt(), or nextLine()) is successfully called. Methods like hasNextInt() are only 'peeks' at the current token. If a token is not an integer and the code skips calling nextInt() as a result, the cursor stays exactly where it was. This causes subsequent hasNextInt() calls in the loop to repeatedly peek at the same invalid token, resulting in a logical stall or an array filled with default values.",
