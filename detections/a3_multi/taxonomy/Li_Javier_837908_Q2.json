Because they view this link as 'active', they fear the variable 'a' might change its value the moment they update 'scores[j]' in the swap, and thus they do not trust 'a' to serve as a stable temporary storage variable.",

The student demonstrates a lack of confidence in this 'snapshot' model by re-fetching the value of 'scores[j]' into a second temporary variable ('tempScore') inside the if-block, instead of simply using 'a' which already holds that value.",
