          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java execution model, the 'break' statement immediately terminates the innermost enclosing loop. Therefore, once the first match is found and the 'break' is executed, no further iterations occur, which inherently prevents any subsequent matches from being processed. The student is treating 'first occurrence' logic and 'loop termination' logic as two separate, disconnected concerns rather than understanding that the termination guarantees the first-found state.",

They may be thinking that without this guard, the variable could somehow be overwritten or set incorrectly on subsequent loop iterations.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't fully trust that a break statement alone will terminate loop execution. In reality, once the break statement executes, the loop exits immediately and subsequent iterations never occur. The condition check is therefore redundant\u2014the break statement is both necessary and sufficient to ensure firstOccurrenceIndex is set exactly once. This suggests the student may have a weaker mental model of break statement semantics and loop termination.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output, but the presence of the redundant condition suggests confused thinking about loop control flow. The guard clause is unnecessary and indicates the student doesn't fully trust the break statement to do its job.",
