To 'freeze' the value for safe use after the array is modified, they create a second variable 'last' to hold a snapshot of 'b'.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, assigning a primitive value (like an int) is a copy-by-value operation. Once 'b' is assigned the value of 'arr[a]', it is an independent copy. There is no reactive connection to the original array index. The student's model mirrors a 'Reactive State Machine' (like Excel) rather than Java's imperative value-copy model.",
