The student may think that assigning `arrayIndex` to `a` and then `arrayIndex - 1` to `b` adds semantic value or clarity to the operation.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the student is using extra variable assignments (`a = arrayIndex` and `b = arrayIndex - 1`) within the loop without any functional purpose. While this doesn't cause incorrect execution in this case, it reflects a misunderstanding about the necessity of intermediate variables. The actual shift operation `userInputArray[a] = userInputArray[b]` is equivalent to `userInputArray[arrayIndex] = userInputArray[arrayIndex - 1]`, and the intermediate variables add cognitive load without benefit. This suggests the student may not fully grasp that loop indices can be used directly in array access operations and feels compelled to create intermediate named references.",
