          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that by computing `c = b - a` and checking `if (c < 0)`, they are correctly identifying when elements need to be swapped for ascending order sorting. They think that if the difference is negative (meaning the second element is smaller), a swap should occur.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has inverted the swap logic. When sorting in ascending order, we should swap when `scores[j] > scores[j+1]`, which means `a > b`. However, the student checks `if (c < 0)`, which is equivalent to `if (b - a < 0)` or `if (b < a)`. This causes the algorithm to swap when the first element is LARGER than the second, which is correct for ascending order, but the way they computed and reasoned about it suggests they may not understand the directional logic clearly. Actually, upon closer inspection, the condition IS correct for ascending order (swap when first > second), but the convoluted way of computing `c = b - a` and checking `c < 0` suggests the student doesn't have a clear mental model of comparison operators and is instead mechanically manipulating arithmetic expressions without understanding the underlying logic.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code will execute correctly and produce the right output, but the misconception manifests in the unnecessarily complex and error-prone approach to a simple comparison.
