They believe they must first 'name' a location or calculation result by assigning it to a variable before the notional machine can use it to look up an array element.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not realize that the array access operator [] evaluates an integer expression at runtime. In the Java execution model, the expression inside the brackets (e.g., 'i - 1' or '0') is evaluated first to produce a primitive int, which is then used as the index. The student's model treats indexing as a simple identifier-based lookup rather than an operational evaluation.",
