          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that for an algorithm to be executed correctly, key logic boundaries and index positions must be assigned to symbolic variable names (like 'a', 'b', and 'c') that represent their 'roles' in the procedure, rather than being treated as dynamic values in a literal expression.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's mental model treats the Java program as a static system of equations or mathematical derivation where variables serve as aliases for specific roles (Start, End, Target). In reality, the Java notional machine is imperative and value-oriented; it evaluates expressions like 'N-1' or literals like '1' directly as values, making the symbolic aliasing on lines 21-23 unnecessary for the computer's execution.",
          "error_manifestation": "In this specific code, it manifests as over-engineered, verbose logic. However, this mental model often leads to 'stale value' bugs in more complex programs because the student may expect the symbolic relationship to remain active even if the underlying source variables (like N) change.",
