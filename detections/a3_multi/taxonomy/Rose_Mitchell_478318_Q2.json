In reality, Java's Scanner.next() is a technical delimiter-based tool that only reads until the next whitespace, regardless of the prompt's intent or the human concept of a 'full name'.",
          "error_manifestation": "If a user enters a name containing a space (e.g., 'Alice Smith'), the program will read 'Alice' as the first name and 'Smith' as the second name, leading to index errors or an InputMismatchException when the loop for integers begins.",

However, the Java Notional Machine treats System.in as a single continuous stream of tokens; the prompts have no functional effect on how Scanner methods interpret the buffer.",
          "error_manifestation": "This belief manifests in the use of two separate loops (one for names, one for scores) that assume the user will enter all names followed by all scores, which would fail if the user attempted to enter data student-by-student (name, then score).",
