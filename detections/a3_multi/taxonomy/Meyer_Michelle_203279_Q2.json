          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the Scanner's input buffer is a continuous, sequential stream that is entirely independent of the console output. The Scanner does not know that a 'names' prompt was printed; it simply takes the next token available. If the user provides data in a different order (such as name followed by score pairs), the program would crash or store scores in the names array because the code assumes the input stream will be partitioned exactly like the prompts.",
