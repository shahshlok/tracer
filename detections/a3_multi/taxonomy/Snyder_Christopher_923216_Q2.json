          "conceptual_gap": "The student is relying on an algebraic mental model where comparison is a derived property of subtraction ($a > b \\iff a - b > 0$). While mathematically sound, the Java execution model provides direct comparison operators ($<$ and $>$). The student's approach is more complex and risks integer overflow, which would not occur with direct comparison.",
          "error_manifestation": "In this specific program, it results in unnecessary variable overhead. However, in programs with larger numeric ranges, it would cause logic errors due to integer overflow (e.g., if subtraction results in a value outside the bounds of an int).",
