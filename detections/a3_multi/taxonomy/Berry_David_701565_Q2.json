While the code executes correctly in this specific case because the outer loop contains only the inner loop as its body, and the inner loop contains only the if-statement, it suggests a mental model similar to Python where white space defines blocks. This would fail if the student tried to add a second statement (e.g., a print) inside a loop without adding braces.",
