They think this correctly covers all elements that need shifting.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's loop iterates from index N-2 down to 0, which means it processes N-1 iterations (indices N-2, N-3, ..., 1, 0). However, when shifting right, you need to start from the second-to-last position and move backwards to avoid overwriting. The loop should iterate from index N-2 down to 0, but the student has set up the indices in a way that works correctly by accident for the shift operation itself. Upon closer inspection, the loop correctly shifts arr[i] into arr[i+1] for all i from N-2 down to 0, which is the correct approach. The code should work as intended for the array shifting logic itself.",

The variables `b = N - 2` and `c = 0` add unnecessary indirection. A cleaner approach would be to write `for (int i = N - 2; i >= 0; i--)` directly.
