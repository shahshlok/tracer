          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, Scanner.nextLine() returns an empty string (not null) when it reaches end-of-stream, but when the user enters text and hits enter, it always returns a non-null String. The null check is unnecessary after a successful nextLine() call during normal input flow. The student may believe that user input could somehow fail to initialize the variable, or that null is a possible return value from nextLine() in typical usage scenarios.",

The null check combined with the intermediate upperInput variable suggests the student may not fully grasp that string operations can be chained directly without intermediate validation steps, and that the problem's note about immutability means each operation returns a new string rather than modifying the original.",
