          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that using intermediate variables (b and c) to represent loop bounds is necessary or beneficial, suggesting a misunderstanding of how loop variables and bounds work. The student may think that the loop needs 'starting point' and 'ending point' stored separately rather than understanding that loop bounds can be literal expressions.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student doesn't fully grasp that loop bounds (i < N) are evaluated directly at runtime. Instead, they've introduced unnecessary variable assignments (b = 0, c = N) that add complexity without benefit. This suggests confusion about whether loop conditions are 'static' values that must be pre-computed or dynamic expressions evaluated each iteration.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error or incorrect output, but the code is unnecessarily verbose and suggests the student doesn't understand that 0 and N can be used directly in the loop condition.",

They may not fully trust that 'break' alone terminates the loop, or they may think the index needs to be 'saved' externally.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the code is actually correct in this regard, the pattern suggests the student may not be entirely confident that 'break' will terminate the loop. A clearer understanding would involve recognizing that 'break' immediately exits the loop, and the assignment is sufficient. The student's approach works but indicates they may be thinking of 'break' as needing supplementary logic rather than a complete loop termination mechanism.",
