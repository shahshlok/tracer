They may think that using the original variables (0, N, -1) directly in the for loop won't work, so they must alias them.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has created three unnecessary variables (a=0, b=N, c=-1) that serve no functional purpose. In Java, you can directly use literal values and the loop counter in expressions without creating intermediate variables. The variables a, b, c add cognitive overhead without providing any benefit. This suggests the student doesn't fully understand that variable assignments are not required to 'prepare' values for use in loop conditions and initialization\u2014you can use expressions and values directly.",

They may also think that re-declaring or reusing variables across different scopes requires explicit pre-declaration.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student declares `int i = 0;` on line 25, then uses this same variable in the for loop on line 28. While this works, it's not idiomatic Java. The standard practice is to declare the loop variable within the for loop itself (`for (int i = 0; ...)`). This suggests the student may not fully understand loop variable scope and the preference for limiting variable scope to where it's needed. However, the code functions correctly, so this is a style/best-practice issue rather than a fundamental misconception.",

They may think that modifying `index_result` directly in the loop would not properly 'transfer' the value for later printing.",

Instead, they use an intermediate variable `c`, then assign `c` to `index_result` after the loop (line 37).
