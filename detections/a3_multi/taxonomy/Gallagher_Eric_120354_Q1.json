          "conceptual_gap": "While the logic does technically work (assigning j=n will cause j<n to become false), this reveals a misunderstanding about best practices and loop control. The student is using a variable assignment as an implicit exit mechanism rather than understanding that they could use a break statement or return early. More importantly, the student may not fully grasp that j=n is a side effect that happens to work, rather than the idiomatic way to exit a loop once a target is found.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output for the given sample, but demonstrates poor understanding of loop control flow and search patterns. The approach is unconventional and suggests the student doesn't fully understand loop termination mechanisms.",
