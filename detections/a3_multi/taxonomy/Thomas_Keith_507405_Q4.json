They treat these as 'let' statements in a math proof rather than dynamic variables.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student is treating Java's imperative execution model as an Algebraic Syntax Machine. They create redundant memory aliases (c = N, b = 0) because they do not yet grasp that the underlying variables (like N) or literal values (like 0) are stable and should be used directly. They also demonstrate a 'snapshot' mental model, where they feel the need to 'capture' the value of N into c for the final output loop, despite N never changing.",

They guard the assignment of 'last' and the assignment of 'arr[0]' with two identical, separate 'if (N > 0)' checks.
