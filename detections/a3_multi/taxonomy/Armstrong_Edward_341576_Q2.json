          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, primitive types like int are passed by value.

          "error_manifestation": "The code actually works correctly despite this misconception because the student directly modifies the array elements. However, the pattern of reading into a temporary variable and then not using it properly indicates confusion about whether the variable refers to the array element or holds an independent copy.",
