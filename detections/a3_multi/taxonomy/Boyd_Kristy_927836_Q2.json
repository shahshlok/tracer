          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly implemented the core bubble sort algorithm mechanics (nested loops, swapping), but there is a logical misunderstanding about what the problem requires. The problem asks to sort in ascending order AND then print the student with the highest score. The student's code does sort in ascending order (smallest to largest), placing the maximum value at the last index, which is correct. However, re-reading the problem statement more carefully: the requirement is to 'sort the data based on scores in ascending order' and then 'Print the name and score of the student with the highest score.' The student's implementation is actually correct for this interpretation. Upon deeper inspection, the code logic is sound\u2014it performs bubble sort correctly, maintains parallel array consistency, and correctly identifies the top student. There is NO actual misconception in the notional machine here; the code is functionally correct.",
