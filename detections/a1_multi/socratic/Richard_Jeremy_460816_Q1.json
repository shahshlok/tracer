          "conceptual_gap": "The Java execution model treats System.out.print and Scanner calls as entirely independent operations. The computer has no understanding of the labels 'v0, v1, and t' within the prompt; the association between input and variable is determined strictly by the sequential execution of the nextDouble() methods.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, closing a Scanner that is wrapped around System.in also closes the underlying standard input stream.
