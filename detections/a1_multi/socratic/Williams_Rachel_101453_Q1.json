          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, closing a Scanner that wraps System.in also closes the underlying System.in stream. Unlike file-based streams, System.in is a global resource that should generally remain open for the duration of the program because it cannot be reopened once closed. While harmless in this single-purpose script, it reflects a misunderstanding of how wrappers interact with standard system streams.",
