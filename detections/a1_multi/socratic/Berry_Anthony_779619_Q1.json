          "conceptual_gap": "There isn\u2019t an obvious gap here: this is essentially the correct Java execution model for this problem. The prompt string is for the human (not the computer), variables do not auto-update (but the student doesn\u2019t rely on auto-updates), Java arithmetic uses the expected operators for this formula, and Scanner doesn\u2019t modify previous variables in surprising ways. The only subtle conceptual issue that could arise (but isn\u2019t shown as a mistake) is thinking the prompt affects input parsing; in Java it doesn\u2019t\u2014prompting and reading are separate actions.",
