The code demonstrates an accurate understanding that: (1) prompts are just output text, (2) values come from Scanner reads, (3) variables don\u2019t auto-update unless reassigned, (4) exponentiation isn\u2019t assumed (they correctly square via multiplication), (5) Math.sqrt returns a new value rather than modifying variables in place, and (6) doubles are used consistently so type conversion issues are avoided.",
