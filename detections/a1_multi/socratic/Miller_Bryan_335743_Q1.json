          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the string concatenation operator (+) has a higher or equal precedence to mathematical division (/), which would lead to the program attempting to join the string with the first part of the math expression before the division is completed unless the entire calculation is isolated with an extra set of parentheses.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's operator precedence, multiplicative operators (*, /) are higher than additive operators (+), including the overloaded '+' operator for String concatenation. Therefore, the division will naturally be evaluated before the result is appended to the string, making the outermost parentheses redundant.",

          "conceptual_gap": "While the Java compiler is technically whitespace-insensitive, the notional machine operates on a nested scope model (the main method inside the class). Failing to indent suggests the student perceives the code as a flat, linear sequence of commands rather than a structured set of nested containers.",
          "error_manifestation": "Lack of indentation making the code difficult to read and potentially leading to errors in more complex programs when managing multiple nested curly braces.",
