The student thinks that as long as the computation is correct mathematically, the code is well-written.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the code does compute the correct result, the student appears to lack understanding that variable names should communicate intent to human readers and future maintainers. In Java, code is read far more often than it is written. The student has not grasped that naming conventions (like using 'x1', 'y1', 'x2', 'y2', 'deltaX', 'deltaY', 'distance') would make the code self-documenting and maintainable. The student treats variables as mere placeholders for intermediate values rather than meaningful identifiers.",

The student thinks each intermediate variable assignment is a necessary and helpful step.",
