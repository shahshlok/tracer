However, the naming of the intermediate variable 'a' to represent only (v1 - v0) creates conceptual confusion. In physics, 'a' represents acceleration (the final result), not the change in velocity alone. The student's mental model treats 'a' as a placeholder for the numerator rather than understanding that acceleration is specifically the ratio of velocity change to time. While the code produces correct output, the intermediate variable naming suggests the student may not fully grasp that acceleration is fundamentally a rate (change per unit time), not just a difference.",
