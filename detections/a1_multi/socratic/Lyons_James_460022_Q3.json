          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `System.out.print(...)` only displays text. It does not capture input or link the words \"x1\" and \"y1\" to variables. Input happens only when you explicitly call methods like `input.nextDouble()`; those calls read tokens from standard input regardless of what the prompt says.",
          "error_manifestation": "This belief often shows up as programs that print prompts but don\u2019t actually read input (or read the wrong amount). In this specific code, they *do* read input correctly, so it doesn\u2019t cause an error here\u2014but the prompt could mislead the student into thinking the prompt itself drives the input process.",

          "conceptual_gap": "Java does not use `^` for exponentiation (it\u2019s bitwise XOR). Squaring is commonly done as `dx * dx` (as the student did) or `Math.pow(dx, 2)`. This misconception is common because the formula is written with superscripts.",
          "error_manifestation": "If the student had used `^2`, it would compile but compute the wrong result (because XOR), leading to incorrect distance values. In this submission, the student avoided the error, but the structure `dx * dx` suggests they may be compensating for the lack of `^2`.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `Math.sqrt(a)` returns a computed `double`; it does not modify `a` (and in this case it can\u2019t, because `a` is an expression, not a variable). If you want to keep the result, you assign it (as the student did). Beginners sometimes think the method \"acts on\" the variable in-place.",
          "error_manifestation": "If this misconception were stronger, the student might write `Math.sqrt(distance);` expecting `distance` to change, which would produce no change and possibly unused-value warnings.
