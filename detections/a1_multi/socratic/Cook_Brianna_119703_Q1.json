          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, there is no semantic link between a prompt string and the subsequent data collection. The computer executes Scanner calls sequentially; the first token is assigned to the first variable being assigned in code, regardless of the prompt's instructions. The computer has no understanding of what 'v0' or 'v1' means in the context of the user's input.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program will result in a logical (physics) error if the user enters values in an order different from the prompt (e.g., entering '1.5 3 30.4' instead of '3 30.4 1.5'), as the program will incorrectly assign the first value to v0 even though it was intended as the time t.",
