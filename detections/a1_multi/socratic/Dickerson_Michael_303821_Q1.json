          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not yet realize that the Java Scanner's 'next' methods (like nextDouble) are token-based and whitespace-agnostic. The Scanner does not distinguish between a space and a newline when searching for the next available token; thus, entering values on separate lines would result in the same program behavior.",
          "error_manifestation": "This belief doesn't cause a runtime error in this specific program, but it might lead the student to write overly complex logic (like reading a whole line and parsing it) in future tasks where they think multi-line input is required.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In Java's I/O model, closing a 'wrapper' like Scanner also closes the underlying stream it is reading from. Closing a Scanner wrapped around System.in closes the standard input stream for the entire application, which is a global resource. While harmless in this short script, it reveals a mental model where the Scanner and the Input Stream are not understood as distinct entities with different lifecycles.",
