They correctly treat prompts as just output text, they explicitly update variables rather than expecting automatic updates, they avoid using ^ for exponentiation, they use Math.sqrt correctly (as returning a value rather than modifying an argument), and they use doubles consistently so there\u2019s no hidden integer-division/type-conversion issue.",
