          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that by calculating (v1 - v0) first and storing it in variable 'a', they are properly implementing the acceleration formula a = (v1 - v0) / t. However, they have misunderstood what the intermediate variable 'a' represents in the context of the formula\u2014they appear to think that assigning (v1 - v0) to a variable called 'a' somehow fulfills the acceleration calculation, when in fact they need to divide by t in the same step or ensure the division happens afterward.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's code assigns (v1 - v0) to the variable 'a' on line 10, which gives 'a' a value of 27.4 when using the sample input (30.4 - 3 = 27.4). Then on line 11, they divide this intermediate result by t. While mathematically this produces the correct result (27.4 / 1.5 = 18.266666666666666), the naming convention is misleading and suggests the student may not fully understand that 'a' in the formula represents the final acceleration, not an intermediate step. The actual gap here is subtle: the code works correctly by accident of order of operations, but the student's variable naming suggests a conceptual misunderstanding about what intermediate values mean in formula decomposition.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code actually produces correct output for the given sample input, so there is no runtime error or wrong answer visible in this case. However, the variable naming and decomposition of the formula reveal a potential misunderstanding about formula implementation.",
