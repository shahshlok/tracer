A sequence of digits such as '00' is processed as a single numeric token (0.0). The student's mental model fails to recognize that without an explicit delimiter like a space or newline, the Scanner cannot terminate the current input call and proceed to the next.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program will appear to hang or 'wait' incorrectly. If a user enters '00' for the first prompt, the first nextDouble() call will consume the value 0.0, and the second nextDouble() call will block execution while waiting for a second token, preventing the second prompt from appearing as shown in the sample run.",
