          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java Notional Machine, variables are named locations in memory. Once a value is stored in a variable (e.g., via nextDouble()), that variable name can be used directly in any expression. There is no architectural or semantic requirement to 'stage' or 'transfer' values into simplified placeholders before calculation. This behavior also leads to 'semantic collision', as the student reuses 'a' (the variable for acceleration) as a temporary holder for velocity.",

          "conceptual_gap": "In programming, while variable names are technically arbitrary, they serve as the bridge between the domain model (math) and the execution model. The student fails to recognize that using the symbol 'a' for an input (velocity) when it is already defined as the output (acceleration) in the provided formula creates a cognitive conflict and makes the code semantically incorrect despite numerical correctness.",
