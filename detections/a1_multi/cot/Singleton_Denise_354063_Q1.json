          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that calculating acceleration only requires finding the difference between final and initial velocity, and then dividing by time. They think a = (v1 - v0) / t can be split into two separate steps without recognizing that the complete formula requires the full numerator to be divided by the denominator.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly identified the mathematical formula a = (v1 - v0) / t but implemented it as two separate operations: first computing a = v1 - v0, then computing averageAcceleration = a / t. While this is mathematically equivalent due to associativity of division, the variable naming 'a' for the intermediate result (v1 - v0) is misleading and suggests the student views these as two independent calculations rather than components of a single formula. More critically, the student's approach could indicate they don't fully understand that (v1 - v0) / t is a single atomic calculation in the formula, not a two-step process with an intermediate result labeled 'a'.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces the correct numerical output for the given test case, but the implementation reveals a misunderstanding of formula structure. With input 3, 30.4, 1.5: a = 30.4 - 3 = 27.4, then averageAcceleration = 27.4 / 1.5 = 18.266666666666666, which matches the expected output. However, the misnamed intermediate variable 'a' for a velocity difference (not acceleration) suggests confused reasoning about what each variable represents in the formula.",
