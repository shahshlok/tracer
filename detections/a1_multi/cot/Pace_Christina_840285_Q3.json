          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, variable names carry no semantic meaning to the runtime beyond identifying storage locations. Correctness depends on consistently mapping each input value (x1, y1, x2, y2) to the correct variable and then using that mapping correctly in the formula. Here the program reads x1 into y and y1 into n, which is confusing but still mathematically consistent because the formula uses (a-y) as (x2-x1) and (b-n) as (y2-y1). So this is a potential misconception risk, but it does not cause incorrect output for this program as written.",

In Java, variable names are just identifiers\u2014they don't inherently carry meaning beyond what the programmer intends. The student appears to think that by naming variables 'y', 'n', 'a', 'b', the program will somehow understand that these correspond to x1, y1, x2, y2 respectively. However, the code actually reads: (1st input \u2192 y), (2nd input \u2192 n), (3rd input \u2192 a), (4th input \u2192 b). When the distance formula is applied as Math.sqrt((a-y)*(a-y)+(b-n)*(b-n)), it computes the distance using the 3rd minus 1st input and 4th minus 2nd input, which is mathematically correct for the input order received, but logically represents (x2-x1) and (y2-y1) where x1=y, y1=n, x2=a, y2=b. The student's variable naming is misleading and suggests they may not fully understand that variable names are arbitrary labels, not magic indicators of their purpose.",
