          "conceptual_gap": "Java executes using the exact variables you define; there is no implicit link between a variable name and a mathematical role like x1/x2. If the student later confuses which variable represents which coordinate (e.g., n is actually x2, z is y2), the program will still run but the meaning can easily drift from the intended formula. The mental model gap is assuming the computer \"understands\" the coordinate roles rather than strictly following the chosen variable bindings.",
