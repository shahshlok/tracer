          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java notional machine, 'double' values are represented using IEEE 754 binary floating-point. Because many decimal fractions (like 23.5 or 5.2) cannot be represented exactly in binary, intermediate rounding occurs. The order of operations (associativity) can change where these rounding errors occur, leading to a different bit pattern and a different final decimal string representation (e.g., ending in ...53 instead of ...535).",
