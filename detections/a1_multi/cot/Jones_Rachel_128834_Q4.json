This causes the variables to 'shift' and store the wrong values (e.g., y1 might receive the value intended for x2).",

The input `00` is a single token that parses to the single value `0.0`. It does not automatically become two inputs (0 and 0). After consuming `00` for `x1`, the next `nextDouble()` call blocks waiting for the next token (the y value). The sample run format strongly suggests entering each point as a pair without whitespace, but the program requires two separate numbers (e.g., `0 0`) per point.",
