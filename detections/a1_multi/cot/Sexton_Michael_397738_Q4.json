          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when they print \"(x1, y1):\" and then call nextDouble() twice, the user will input two space-separated numbers on the same line (like \"0 0\"), and Java will correctly parse them as x1 and y1 respectively.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has misunderstood how the sample input is formatted. Looking at the sample run, the input \"00\" on one line represents a single coordinate pair, where the format is implicit (first digit is x, second is y, or they are concatenated). However, the student's code calls nextDouble() which expects actual numeric input separated by whitespace. When the sample input \"00\" is provided as a single token, nextDouble() will parse it as 0.0, but the code calls nextDouble() twice in succession, expecting two separate values. The sample shows \"(x1, y1):00\" where \"00\" appears to mean x1=0, y1=0, but the student's parsing logic doesn't match this format. The student should parse the input differently or the sample input format is being misinterpreted. Given the sample input shows \"00\", \"50\", \"05\", it appears the format is two-digit coordinates where the first digit is x and second is y (or they represent coordinate pairs in some other format not clearly matching nextDouble() behavior).",
          "error_manifestation": "The program will fail to match the expected behavior with the provided sample input. When \"00\" is entered, nextDouble() will read 0, but then the second nextDouble() call will fail because there's no second number on that input line, causing an InputMismatchException. Alternatively, if \"0\" and \"0\" are entered on separate lines, the program might work, but it doesn't match the sample input format shown.",

This implies there should be a method call to a distance calculation function from Q3. The student instead inline-computed the Euclidean distance formula without creating or calling a separate distance method.
