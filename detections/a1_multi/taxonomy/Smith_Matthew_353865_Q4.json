          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the computer uses the content and structure of the prompt string (e.g., \"(x1, y1):\") as a template to parse user input, assuming the Scanner will automatically split a single string of characters like '00' into two values or skip structural characters like commas and parentheses because they were shown in the prompt.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to realize that the output stream (System.out) and input stream (Scanner) are completely independent. The Scanner does not 'read' the prompt to understand the expected format; it tokenizes input based on whitespace. A sequence like '00' is a single numeric token in Java, and a sequence like '(0,0)' will cause a crash because Scanner.nextDouble() does not automatically strip non-numeric characters shown in a print statement.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program will hang or exhibit input misalignment; if the user enters '00', the first variable (x1) will consume the entire token, and the program will wait for additional input before ever displaying the next prompt.",
