While it's true that Math.sqrt() of a negative number returns NaN, the student has added defensive checks that suggest they believe the check is mandatory before the operation. In reality, Math.sqrt() will execute regardless; the conditional is unnecessary here since the algorithm (Heron's formula) should never produce a negative product for a valid triangle. The real issue is that the check masks the underlying problem rather than solving it.",
