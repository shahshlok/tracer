More importantly, they seem to believe that adding a runtime check protects against invalid mathematical operations, when in reality: (1) the formula structure makes this check redundant, and (2) if sum were somehow negative due to floating-point edge cases, Math.sqrt() would return NaN rather than throwing an exception. The check itself doesn't prevent incorrect behavior\u2014it just masks the real issue.",
