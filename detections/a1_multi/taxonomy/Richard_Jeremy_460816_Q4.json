          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that the Scanner's parsing behavior is informed by the preceding print prompt. Specifically, they believe that by providing a visual prompt such as '(x1, y1):', the machine will automatically understand that it should parse a coordinate pair even if the user provides it in a non-standard way (like '00' instead of '0 0') or with decorative punctuation like commas and parentheses.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In the actual Java execution model, the Scanner is completely independent of the print buffer. Scanner.nextDouble() uses whitespace as a default delimiter to identify tokens; it cannot 'reach into' a single token like '50' to extract two separate values (5 and 0), nor can it skip punctuation marks like '(' unless specifically instructed to do so. The student's code relies on the computer interpreting the user's input based on the context of the prompt rather than strict tokenization rules.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program will likely hang or enter an unexpected state because each prompt calls nextDouble() twice, but the sample input '00' or '50' only provides a single token. This will cause the second nextDouble() call for the first coordinate to consume the first value intended for the second coordinate.",
