However, they don't recognize that floating-point arithmetic in Java can produce unexpectedly long decimal representations (like 34.297872340425535) due to the binary representation of decimal numbers.

          "conceptual_gap": "While not strictly a notional machine misconception about execution, this reflects a gap in understanding output conventions and best practices.
