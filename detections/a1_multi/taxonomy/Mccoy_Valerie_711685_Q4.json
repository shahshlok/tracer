Specifically, they believe that by printing '(x1, y1):', the Scanner will know to look for two separate numbers in a single sequence of characters (like '00' in the sample run) or will know which variable to assign based on the labels in the string.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student fails to recognize that System.out (the output stream) and System.in (the input stream) are independent. The Scanner does not 'see' the labels or parentheses in the prompt; it simply searches the input stream for tokens. Furthermore, nextDouble() consumes all contiguous numeric characters as a single double-precision value and requires whitespace (by default) to differentiate between distinct variable inputs.",
          "error_manifestation": "If the user inputs '00' (expecting two zeros) as suggested in the sample run, the first nextDouble() will consume it as a single value (0.0), causing the program to hang while waiting for the next input, or resulting in an InputMismatchException if the user provides punctuation like '(0, 0)'.",
