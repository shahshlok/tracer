The student appears to confuse the scope and binding of identifiers, thinking they can use the same name for fundamentally different types of data without issues.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code contains a critical naming collision: the Scanner is named 'x' but the program also uses x1, x2, x3 as coordinate variables. While this technically compiles because x1, x2, x3 are distinct identifiers from x, it demonstrates very poor naming practice and suggests the student doesn't fully understand variable scope and namespace management.
