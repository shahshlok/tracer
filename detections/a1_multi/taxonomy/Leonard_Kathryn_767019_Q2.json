          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that dividing by a floating-point number that could theoretically be zero is a dangerous operation that must be explicitly guarded with a conditional check. They think that without this guard, the program will crash or fail to compute the result correctly.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In reality, Java's floating-point arithmetic handles division by zero gracefully by returning special values (Infinity, -Infinity, or NaN) rather than throwing an exception. The student has conflated floating-point division behavior with integer division or has misunderstood when ArithmeticException actually occurs. More importantly, in this specific problem context, the input validation is unnecessary because the problem specification does not require error handling for invalid inputs, and the sample run shows no such check. This suggests the student is over-engineering the solution with defensive programming that adds complexity without addressing any actual requirement.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code produces correct output, but demonstrates flawed reasoning about when division by zero is actually problematic in Java. The conditional logic is unnecessary and suggests a misconception about floating-point arithmetic safety.",
