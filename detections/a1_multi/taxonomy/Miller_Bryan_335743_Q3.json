          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not realize that Java identifiers are flexible and can include digits (e.g., 'x1', 'x2') as long as they don't start with one. Their mental model of a variable is strictly limited to single-letter mathematical symbols (x, y, n, z), which leads to less readable code.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code runs correctly, but the variable names 'n' and 'z' are arbitrary and do not reflect the 'x2' and 'y2' identifiers provided in the problem description, potentially leading to confusion in more complex logic.",
