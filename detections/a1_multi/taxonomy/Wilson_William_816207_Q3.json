More importantly, in this specific formula the radicand (xDiff^2 + yDiff^2) is mathematically guaranteed to be >= 0 (aside from rare floating-point roundoff producing a tiny negative), so the check is unnecessary and can hide problems by producing an incorrect distance of 0.0 if it ever triggers.",
