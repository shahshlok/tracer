          "conceptual_gap": "In the actual Java execution model, variable declarations and initializations are discrete procedural events that occur once. Chaining them with commas is a syntactical shorthand for a sequence of one-time assignments. The student's grouping suggests a mental model of 'live' spreadsheet-like cells (Reactive State Machine) rather than a sequence of instructions.",
          "error_manifestation": "The student's code is logically correct in this instance, but this mental model typically leads to errors if the student expects a result variable to automatically update when an input variable is modified later in the program.",
