They think that if the condition is false, the variable will retain its initial value (0) and this is an acceptable way to handle the problem.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student is not recognizing that when t equals 0, the division would be undefined (division by zero), which is a mathematical error, not a programming error that can be solved by pre-initialization. The variable n will simply be printed as 0 when t=0, which is mathematically incorrect. The student should either: (1) prevent invalid input, (2) handle the division by zero case explicitly with an error message, or (3) assume valid input without the conditional. The initialization pattern suggests the student views the variable as a 'default fallback' rather than understanding the actual mathematical constraint.",
