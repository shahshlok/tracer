They compute distance/mpg into 'a', then multiply by pricePerGallon into 'b', then assign 'b' to 'cost', as if each step needs its own container.",
          "conceptual_gap": "While the code is functionally correct, the student appears to have a misconception about variable scope, reusability, or the nature of expressions. In Java, you can chain operations directly (distance / mpg_value * pricePerGallon) or assign to one variable. The use of intermediate variables 'a' and 'b' suggests the student may not fully understand that expressions evaluate to values that can be used immediately, or believes that the computer needs explicit 'holding places' for partial results to process correctly.",
          "error_manifestation": "No runtime error or wrong output\u2014the code executes correctly and produces the expected result. However, the pattern suggests incomplete understanding of how expressions and variable assignment work together.",
