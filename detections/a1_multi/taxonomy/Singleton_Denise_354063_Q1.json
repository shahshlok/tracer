However, they appear to have misunderstood or incompletely implemented the formula structure, treating the intermediate result as the final acceleration component rather than recognizing it as part of a complete expression.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly identified the numerator (v1 - v0) and correctly divided by t, so the formula is actually implemented correctly in the code. Upon closer inspection, the code matches the required formula exactly. The student's mental model here appears sound: they recognize that intermediate calculations can be stored in variables before being used in further calculations.",
