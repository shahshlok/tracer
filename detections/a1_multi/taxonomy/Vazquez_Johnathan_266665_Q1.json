          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, expressions can be composed directly (e.g., (v1 - v0) / t). Creating extra variables is not wrong, but it can indicate a mental model where code must follow algebraic \u201clines\u201d rather than understanding that the JVM evaluates an expression as a whole using operator precedence and parentheses. This is more of a style/understanding issue than a functional bug here.",
