Specifically, they believe that a prompt like '(x1, y1):' directs the computer to split a single input token (like '00' or '50') into two separate variables, or that the Scanner will automatically ignore punctuation like parentheses and commas if the user follows the prompt's formatting.",

The Scanner.nextDouble() method consumes entire tokens based on whitespace delimiters and does not interpret input based on the preceding prompt's structure. If a user enters '00' (as shown in the sample run), it is parsed as a single double (0.0), leaving the second variable (y1) to wait for the next token in the stream, which shifts the subsequent inputs and leads to a logic error.",
