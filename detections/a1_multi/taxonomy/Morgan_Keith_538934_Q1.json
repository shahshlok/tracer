They believe that by wrapping every nextDouble() in an if-statement, they are creating an independent, safe check for each variable.",
          "conceptual_gap": "In the Java Scanner model, hasNextDouble() is a non-consuming look-ahead. It peeks at the current token but does not move the pointer. If the current token is not a double, hasNextDouble() returns false and the token remains in the buffer. Subsequent calls to hasNextDouble() will look at the exact same invalid token, resulting in all three input variables remaining at their default value of 0.0 if the first input provided is invalid.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program fails silently if non-numeric data is entered. If the first token is 'abc', all three if-statements fail because the scanner never moves past 'abc', leaving all variables at 0.0 and resulting in an output of 0.0.",

Closing it mid-program prevents any further input reading for the duration of the execution.",
