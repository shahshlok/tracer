          "conceptual_gap": "The student has correctly understood how Heron's formula works mathematically, but they are decomposing it into excessive intermediate variables (a, b, c, d) that represent the factors. While this is not technically wrong, it suggests a misconception about expression evaluation: they may believe that the computer cannot evaluate a complex nested expression like Math.sqrt(s * (s - side1) * (s - side2) * (s - side3)) directly, and instead requires each sub-expression to be broken down and stored. This reflects a belief that complex expressions must be linearized and stored rather than evaluated compositionally.",
