          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, the Scanner class uses a delimiter (by default, whitespace) to separate the input stream into tokens. The nextDouble() method consumes an entire whitespace-delimited token as a single value. If '00' is entered without a space, it is processed as a single numeric token (0.0). The program then stops and waits for the next token for the subsequent nextDouble() call, which contradicts the sample run where prompts appear to move sequentially.",
          "error_manifestation": "The program will fail to produce the correct area because it will assign the combined token (e.g., '50' as 50.0) to a single coordinate variable and then hang while waiting for additional input for the next variable, leading to a logical mismatch with the intended triangle points.",
