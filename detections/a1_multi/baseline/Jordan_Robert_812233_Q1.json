More fundamentally, they may misunderstand that Java's division operation will raise an ArithmeticException for division by zero, and that this is the appropriate behavior for invalid inputs rather than something to silently suppress with a conditional check. The problem context assumes the user will provide meaningful physical values, not edge cases that violate the physics formula's preconditions.",
