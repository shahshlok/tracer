          "conceptual_gap": "The student has misunderstood how Scanner.nextDouble() works with user input. While the code will technically work if the user enters two space-separated or whitespace-separated numbers, the problem specification and sample run suggest a different input format. The sample run shows '(x1, y1):00' which appears to be a single input '0 0', but the prompt format strongly implies the user should enter coordinates as 'x y' on one line. The student's approach works by accident if the user enters space-separated values, but there's a conceptual gap: the student doesn't appear to recognize that they should be parsing a single line containing two coordinates, rather than making two sequential read calls. This works in practice but reflects a lack of clarity about the intended input format and potentially about how to robustly parse structured input.",
