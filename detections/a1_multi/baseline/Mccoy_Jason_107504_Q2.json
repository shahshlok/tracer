If the assignment expects a specific number of decimal places (commonly 2 for dollars), they must use formatting (e.g., `System.out.printf(\"%.2f\", d)`).

The student's mental model suggests they don't fully understand that division in Java works correctly with any non-zero divisor, and they're applying overly defensive programming when the problem specification guarantees valid inputs.
