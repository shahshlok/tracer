The sample run is ambiguous about whether '00' means two separate inputs or a single malformed input. However, the student's code will fail to parse the sample input correctly because it attempts to read two doubles for each prompt, while the sample appears to show coordinate pairs being entered in a compressed format (like '00' for point (0,0)).
