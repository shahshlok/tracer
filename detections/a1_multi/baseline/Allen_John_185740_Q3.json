          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that when reading input with `nextDouble()` calls in sequence on the same line, the order of variable assignment in the code determines which input value goes to which variable. Specifically, the student thinks that writing `double y=x.nextDouble(),n=x.nextDouble();` will read x1 first into y and y1 into n, based on the visual order in the code.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student confuses the order of operations in variable declaration with the logical meaning of the variable names. In Java, `nextDouble()` calls execute left-to-right and consume input left-to-right from the input stream, regardless of variable names or semantics. The student has assigned the first input (x1=1) to variable y, and the second input (y1=3.5) to variable n. Then for the second input line, they correctly assign x2 to variable a and y2 to variable b. This means the distance formula uses the wrong pair of coordinates: it computes the distance from (y1, x1) to (x2, y2) instead of from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).",
