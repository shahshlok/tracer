While handling division by zero can be important in real-world applications, the problem statement provides no indication that t could be zero or that such edge cases need handling. The student is over-engineering the solution by adding logic not required by the specification. More importantly, initializing n to 0.0 and conditionally computing the acceleration suggests the student doesn't trust that the input will be valid, which contradicts the problem's implicit assumptions.",
