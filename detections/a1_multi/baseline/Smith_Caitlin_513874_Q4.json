The student expects the user to type '0 0' (separated by space) for the first coordinate pair, but the sample input format '00' suggests the student may have misunderstood how the input should be parsed.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student's code uses nextInt() twice for each coordinate pair, which reads two space-separated integers. However, the sample run shows '(x1, y1):00' which appears to be either a typo in the problem statement or represents '0 0' (with space). The student's implementation is actually correct for reading two integers, but there's confusion about whether the input format shown in the sample ('00', '50', '05') represents proper formatting or if those are shorthand notations that should be interpreted as '0 0', '5 0', '0 5'. The code assumes the user will enter space-separated values, which is the standard Scanner.nextInt() behavior.",
