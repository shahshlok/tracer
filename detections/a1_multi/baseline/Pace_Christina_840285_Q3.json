They assigned the first input value to a variable named 'y' (which should conceptually represent a y-coordinate) and the second input value to a variable named 'n' (which has no meaningful connection to coordinates). The student then uses these misnamed variables in the distance formula without recognizing the semantic mismatch between the variable names and their actual roles.",

The problem specifies that the first two inputs should be x1 and y1, but the student read x1 into 'y' and y1 into 'n'. This is not a syntax error but reveals a fundamental confusion about tracking which value represents which coordinate throughout the program's execution. The formula itself is mathematically correct in structure, but the variables are assigned to the wrong coordinate values, causing incorrect computation.",
          "error_manifestation": "Wrong output - the computed distance will be incorrect because x1 is being subtracted from x2 incorrectly (y is subtracted instead), and y1 is being subtracted from y2 incorrectly (n is subtracted instead).
