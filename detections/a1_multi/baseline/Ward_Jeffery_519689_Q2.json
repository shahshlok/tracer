While Java will evaluate y/n*z left-to-right for operators of equal precedence (so it matches this formula here), the student\u2019s expression suggests a fragile understanding of how to translate formulas and how precedence/associativity affects results (e.g., if they had written y/(n*z), it would change meaning). In this specific code, the expression happens to be correct, but it may reflect a conceptual weakness rather than a robust grasp.",
