          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `*` and `/` have the same precedence and are evaluated left-to-right. While `y/n*z` does compute `(y/n)*z` (which is the correct formula here), students who don\u2019t understand this rule can easily write expressions that work accidentally or fail when the intended formula differs (e.g., `y/(n*z)`). The underlying gap is an incomplete mental model of expression evaluation order and when parentheses are required to match a real-world formula.",
