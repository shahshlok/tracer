          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, `if (true)` has no effect\u2014it always executes and does not add safety or correctness. For the distance formula, `(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2` is always non-negative (up to floating-point rounding), so checking `>= 0` is typically unnecessary; and if rounding ever produced a tiny negative, silently leaving `distance` at 0 would be incorrect handling. Proper validation would check input availability (e.g., `input.hasNextDouble()`) or handle exceptions, not use unconditional/tautological conditions.",
