          "conceptual_gap": "The student misunderstands how Scanner.nextDouble() works with user input. The method reads one double value at a time, separated by whitespace. When the user enters '00', Scanner parses this as a single double value (0.0), not as two coordinates. The student's code calls nextDouble() twice per point, expecting to get x and y separately, but the sample run shows input like '00', '50', '05' which appears to be single tokens. The student's code will actually work correctly with proper whitespace-separated input (0 0, 5 0, 0 5), but the sample run suggests a different input format that the code doesn't handle.",
          "error_manifestation": "The code will not produce the correct output format matching the sample run. If the user enters input exactly as shown in the sample ('00', '50', '05'), the program will crash or hang waiting for additional input, because it expects six separate numeric inputs but the sample only provides three tokens. Alternatively, if run with properly formatted input (0 0 5 0 0 5), the code will produce the correct area, but this doesn't match the specified sample run format.",
