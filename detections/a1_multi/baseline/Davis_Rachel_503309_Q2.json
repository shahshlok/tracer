          "conceptual_gap": "For this problem, the expected computation is always `cost = (distance / mpg) * pricePerGallon`. Guarding with `if (a != 0)` changes the program\u2019s meaning: a price of 0 is a valid numeric input (it should yield cost 0 via the formula, not via skipping the computation). More importantly, if `mpg` is 0, silently printing $0 is not a correct handling; it masks an invalid scenario rather than reporting an error or re-prompting. This reflects a misunderstanding that avoiding an exception by skipping computation is equivalent to correct behavior.",

While division by zero is indeed a runtime error, the problem statement guarantees valid inputs (positive distance, fuel economy, and price). More fundamentally, the student conflates the need for mathematical validity (avoiding division by zero in general) with the need for conditional code structure in this specific problem. Java allows arithmetic operations to proceed directly without conditional guards; the guards here are unnecessary given the problem constraints and add no value while making the code harder to follow. The student's mental model treats arithmetic as fragile and requiring protective conditional wrappers.",
