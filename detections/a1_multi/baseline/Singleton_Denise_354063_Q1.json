While the formula a = (v1 - v0) / t can be written with intermediate steps, the student appears to misunderstand the order and purpose of operations. More critically, by naming the intermediate result 'a' (which conventionally means acceleration), the student suggests confusion about what 'a' represents at each stage. The code works correctly despite this, but it reveals a potential misunderstanding: the student may not fully grasp that (v1 - v0) is not itself acceleration\u2014it's merely the numerator of the acceleration formula. This could indicate a gap in understanding the mathematical relationship and variable semantics.",
