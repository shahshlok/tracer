          "student_thought_process": "The student believes that intermediate calculations should be stored in separate named variables (a, b, c) before performing the final computation, treating each step as a distinct conceptual stage rather than part of a single expression.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student demonstrates a misunderstanding of arithmetic expression evaluation in Java. They appear to think that breaking down the formula a = (v1 - v0) / t into three separate variable assignments (a = v1 - v0, then b = t, then c = a / b) is necessary or more logical than directly computing the result. This suggests a gap between understanding that expressions can be evaluated directly versus the belief that intermediate storage is required for clarity or correctness.",
          "error_manifestation": "While the code produces correct output, the pattern indicates a conceptual misunderstanding about expression evaluation. The student may struggle with complex nested expressions and may incorrectly believe that all intermediate results must be stored.",

          "conceptual_gap": "The student names intermediate variables a, b, c which are semantically meaningless in the context of the physics problem. In the formula a = (v1 - v0) / t, the letter 'a' represents acceleration (the final result), but the student uses 'a' for the numerator (v1 - v0). This suggests the student may not fully understand that variable names should reflect their semantic meaning, or may not be thinking about the problem domain when writing code.",
