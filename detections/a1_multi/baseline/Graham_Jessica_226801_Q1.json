          "conceptual_gap": "While the code does correctly compute (v1 - v0) / t mathematically, the student appears to have misunderstood the formula structure. The variable 'a' is being used to store the numerator (v1 - v0), which is not acceleration\u2014it's just the change in velocity. The student then divides this by t to get the final result. This suggests the student doesn't fully grasp that acceleration is defined as the ratio (v1 - v0) / t as a single operation, not as a two-step process where you first compute the change in velocity and then divide. The mental model shows a lack of understanding that the formula requires dividing the velocity difference directly by time, not computing them separately.",
