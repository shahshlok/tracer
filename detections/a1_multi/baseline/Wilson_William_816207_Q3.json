Additionally, in Java, Math.sqrt of a negative double does not throw an exception; it returns NaN. Using a conditional with a default distance of 0.0 can silently mask issues (e.g., if sumSquares became negative due to NaN propagation or overflow/underflow edge cases), producing a plausible but incorrect output instead of surfacing the problem.",
