          "conceptual_gap": "The student assigned the first input value (x1) to variable 'y' and the second input value (y1) to variable 'n', then used these misaligned variables in the distance formula. This reveals a misconception about how variable assignment works: the student seems to think that the semantic meaning of a variable is independent of what value is actually stored in it, or failed to track which physical variable holds which conceptual value. In reality, once a value is assigned to a variable, that variable contains that specific value for all subsequent operations.",
