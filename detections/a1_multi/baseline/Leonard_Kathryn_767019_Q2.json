          "conceptual_gap": "In Java, dividing a double by 0.0 does not throw an exception; it yields Infinity (or NaN in some cases). More importantly for this problem, the specification implicitly assumes valid inputs (mpg > 0). Adding a conditional that forces gallonsUsed to stay 0.0 when mpg is 0 changes the program\u2019s behavior relative to Java\u2019s floating-point semantics and can silently produce an incorrect cost rather than surfacing an invalid input scenario.",
