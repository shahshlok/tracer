However, the student has conflated the mathematical variable 'a' (which represents acceleration in the formula) with an intermediate step variable, not recognizing that 'a' should represent the final acceleration value, not just the numerator of the acceleration formula.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student understands that the acceleration formula is a = (v1 - v0) / t, but has structured the code to compute v1 - v0 first and store it in 'a', then divide by t. While this produces a correct numerical result, it reveals a misunderstanding of what the intermediate variable represents. The student appears to think 'a' is just a holding variable for part of the calculation rather than recognizing that the full formula should be evaluated to get the final acceleration. More critically, this shows the student may not fully grasp that variables can be named meaningfully to represent the values they hold at each step of computation.",

The student thinks this step-by-step decomposition with multiple variables is necessary or required.",
          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not recognize that while breaking calculations into steps with intermediate variables is sometimes helpful for readability or debugging, it is not necessary here. The formula could be computed directly as (v1 - v0) / t in a single expression and assigned to averageAcceleration. This suggests the student may not fully understand that expressions can be arbitrarily complex and that multiple variables introduce unnecessary complexity without benefit. The student may incorrectly believe that each mathematical operation requires its own variable to hold the result before moving to the next operation.",
