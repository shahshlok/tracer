          "conceptual_gap": "The student does not understand that variables in Java are references to values in memory, and that reassigning values to new variable names does not change the underlying computation or provide any functional benefit. The student appears to conflate the concept of 'renaming for clarity' with a misconception that the original variable names cannot be used directly in formulas, or that intermediate steps are required for correctness. In reality, the formula could be applied directly to v0, v1_value, and t_time without the aliasing step.",
