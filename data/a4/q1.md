### Q1. The Book Class [5 marks]

Write a class `Book` with two private instance variables: `title` (String) and `pages` (int).
1. Write a constructor `public Book(String title, int pages)` that initializes these variables.
2. Write a method `isLong()` that returns `true` if pages > 300.

**Task:** Instantiate a Book with title "Java Programming" and 500 pages, then print if it is long.

**Sample run:**

```text
Book created: Java Programming
Is long? true
```
