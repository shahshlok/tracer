### Q4. Course Roster[5 marks]

Write a program to manage a course roster.
1. Create an array that can hold 5 `Student` objects.
2. **Initialize** the first slot with a Student named "Alice".
3. Print the name of the student in the first slot.

**Note:** Be careful with array initialization vs object initialization.

**Sample run:**

```text
Roster created.
Student at index 0: Alice
```
```
