| Reading data (age, accidents, email) from user                  | +1                  | Level 2: Understand           | Basic Input/Output. The student just needs to know the command to get data. |
| Checking if age or accidents is negative and displaying relevant error message            | +1             | Level 3: Apply                | Applying a conditional check (if < 0) to a standard constraint. |
| Checking rule 1 from the question and displaying relevant error message                   | +1             | Level 3: Apply                | Simple logic. Direct translation of a rule into code. |
| Computing the cost of insurance | +1.5           | Level 4: Analyze              | Higher Weight. This is the core logic. The student must combine multiple variables (age, accidents) to calculate a result. |
| Verifying email format and displaying relevant error message                  | +1.5             | Level 4: Analyze              | String manipulation and pattern matching is harder than basic math. |
| Style / Correctness            | +1             | Level 5: Evaluate             | Judging the quality, flow and variable naming. |
