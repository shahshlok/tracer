### Q4. [6 marks]

Create a program that can calculate the area of a triangle using the following formulae:

$$s=(side1+side2+side3)/2$$
$$area=\sqrt{s(s-side1)(s-side2)(s-side3)}$$

**Instruction:**
To calculate the length of each side, ask the user to input the points ($x$ and $y$) representing the extremities of the triangle and use your program made in question 3 to calculate the length of each side of the triangle.

**Sample run:**

```text
Enter three points for a triangle.
(x1, y1):00
(x2, y2):50
(x3, y3):05
The area of the triangle is 12.5
```
