# Marking Guide for Q3 (5 marks)

| Tasks | Marks | Topic | Why? |
|-------|-------|-------|------|
| Reading input (x1, y1, x2, y2) from user using Scanner | +1 | Reading input from the keyboard | Four values with two prompts - standard I/O |
| Declaring variables with appropriate data types (double) | +1 | Variables, Data types | Same reasoning as previous questions |
| Computing distance using formula: `Math.sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)` | +2 | Variables, Constants | Double weight - introduces Math library usage, requires computing intermediate values (differences, squares), and combining them correctly. More complex than simple arithmetic |
| Displaying the calculated distance with correct message | +1 | Variables | Same as other questions - basic output |
