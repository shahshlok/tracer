Through a simple equation, it is possible to obtain the acceleration of an object using the change in velocity and time.

**Formula:**
$$a=\frac{v_{1}-v_{0}}{t}$$

**Task:**
Write a program that requests from the user the starting velocity $v_{0}$, the final velocity $v_{1}$, and the time $t$ to calculate the average acceleration.

**Sample run:**

```text
Enter v0, v1, and t: 3 30.4 1.5
The average acceleration is 18.266666666666666
```

### Q2. [5 marks]

Create a program that can calculate the cost of a road trip using fuel cost, distance travelled, and fuel economy.

**Sample run:**

```text
Enter the driving distance in miles: 155
Enter miles per gallon: 23.5
Enter price in $ per gallon: 5.2
The cost of driving is $34.297872340425535
```

### Q3. [5 marks]

You are required to create a program that can compute the distance between two specified points, $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2})$.

**Formula:**
The formula to find this distance is:
$$\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}$$

**Note:**
You can complete this problem using the Java method `Math.sqrt(a)` to compute $\sqrt{a}$.

**Sample run:**

```text
Enter x1 and y1: 1 3.5
Enter x2 and y2: 2.1 4.5
The distance of the two points is 1.4866068747318506
```

### Q4. [6 marks]

Create a program that can calculate the area of a triangle using the following formulae:

$$s=(side1+side2+side3)/2$$
$$area=\sqrt{s(s-side1)(s-side2)(s-side3)}$$

**Instruction:**
To calculate the length of each side, ask the user to input the points ($x$ and $y$) representing the extremities of the triangle and use your program made in question 3 to calculate the length of each side of the triangle.

**Sample run:**

```text
Enter three points for a triangle.
(x1, y1):00
(x2, y2):50
(x3, y3):05
The area of the triangle is 12.5
```
