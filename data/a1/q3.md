### Q3. [5 marks]

You are required to create a program that can compute the distance between two specified points, $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2})$.

**Formula:**
The formula to find this distance is:
$$\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}$$

**Note:**
You can complete this problem using the Java method `Math.sqrt(a)` to compute $\sqrt{a}$.

**Sample run:**

```text
Enter x1 and y1: 1 3.5
Enter x2 and y2: 2.1 4.5
The distance of the two points is 1.4866068747318506
```
