### Q1. [4 marks]

Through a simple equation, it is possible to obtain the acceleration of an object using the change in velocity and time.

**Formula:**
$$a=\frac{v_{1}-v_{0}}{t}$$

**Task:**
Write a program that requests from the user the starting velocity $v_{0}$, the final velocity $v_{1}$, and the time $t$ to calculate the average acceleration.

**Sample run:**

```text
Enter v0, v1, and t: 3 30.4 1.5
The average acceleration is 18.266666666666666
```
