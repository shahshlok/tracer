# Marking Guide for Q4 (6 marks)

| Tasks | Marks | Topic | Why? |
|-------|-------|-------|------|
| Reading input (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3) from user using Scanner | +1 | Reading input from the keyboard | Six values but standard Scanner usage - same complexity as others |
| Calculating the three side lengths using distance formula | +2 | Variables, Data types | Highest weight in this task - must apply Q3's logic three separate times. Tests ability to break problem into sub-problems and reuse patterns |
| Computing semi-perimeter: `s = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2` | +1 | Variables | Given formula, straightforward calculation using previously computed sides |
| Computing area using Heron's formula: `Math.sqrt(s*(s-side1)*(s-side2)*(s-side3))` | +1 | Variables, Constants | Direct application of given formula with Math.sqrt - similar complexity to Q3's distance |
| Displaying the calculated area with correct message | +1 | Variables | Same as other questions - basic output |
