### Q3. String Shouter [4 marks]

Write a program that reads a line of text from the user. The program should convert the **entire string to Uppercase** and replace all spaces with underscores (`_`). Print the modified string.

**Note:** In Java, Strings are immutable.

**Sample run:**

```text
Enter text: hello world
Result: HELLO_WORLD
```
