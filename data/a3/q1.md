### Q1. Find the First Occurrence [5 marks]

Write a program that reads an integer `N`, followed by an array of `N` integers. Then read a target number `T`. Print the **index** of the first occurrence of `T` in the array. If `T` is not found, print -1.

**Sample run:**

```text
Enter size: 5
Enter elements: 10 20 30 20 50
Enter target: 20
Found at index: 1
```
