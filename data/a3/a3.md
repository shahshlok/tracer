### Q1. Find the First Occurrence [5 marks]

Write a program that reads an integer `N`, followed by an array of `N` integers. Then read a target number `T`. Print the **index** of the first occurrence of `T` in the array. If `T` is not found, print -1.

**Sample run:**

```text
Enter size: 5
Enter elements: 10 20 30 20 50
Enter target: 20
Found at index: 1
```

### Q2. Student Leaderboard (Parallel Arrays) [6 marks]

Write a program that manages student data using two parallel arrays.
1. Read `N` (number of students).
2. Read `N` names (Strings) into an array `names`.
3. Read `N` scores (integers) into an array `scores`.
4. The program should **sort** the data based on `scores` in ascending order.
5. Print the name and score of the student with the **highest** score.

**Sample run:**

```text
Enter number of students: 3
Enter names: Alice Bob Charlie
Enter scores: 85 92 78
Top student: Bob (92)
```

### Q3. String Shouter [4 marks]

Write a program that reads a line of text from the user. The program should convert the **entire string to Uppercase** and replace all spaces with underscores (`_`). Print the modified string.

**Note:** In Java, Strings are immutable.

**Sample run:**

```text
Enter text: hello world
Result: HELLO_WORLD
```

### Q4. Array Right Shift [5 marks]

Write a program that reads `N` integers into an array. Shift all elements **one position to the right**. The last element should wrap around to become the first element. Print the modified array.

**Sample run:**

```text
Enter size: 4
Enter elements: 1 2 3 4
Shifted: 4 1 2 3
```
