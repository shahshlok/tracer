### Q2. Student Leaderboard (Parallel Arrays) [6 marks]

Write a program that manages student data using two parallel arrays.
1. Read `N` (number of students).
2. Read `N` names (Strings) into an array `names`.
3. Read `N` scores (integers) into an array `scores`.
4. The program should **sort** the data based on `scores` in ascending order.
5. Print the name and score of the student with the **highest** score.

**Sample run:**

```text
Enter number of students: 3
Enter names: Alice Bob Charlie
Enter scores: 85 92 78
Top student: Bob (92)
```
