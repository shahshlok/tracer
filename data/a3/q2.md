### Q2. Number Guessing Game [5 marks]

Write a program where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100. The user guesses until they get it correct. After each wrong guess, the program tells the user whether their guess was "Too high" or "Too low".

**Hint:** Use `Random rand = new Random(); int answer = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;` to generate the secret number.

**Sample run:**

```text
Guess a number (1-100): 50
Too low!
Guess a number (1-100): 75
Too high!
Guess a number (1-100): 62
Correct! You took 3 guesses.
```
