However, the surcharge for accidents has a calculation error. It applies `pay = pay + (pay * 0.25)` which adds 25% of the *current total* (potentially including the age surcharge) instead of 25% of the *basic amount* ($600) or 25% of the total premium *before* the accident surcharge is applied. The example shows '600 (basic) + 25% of 600 (accidents surcharge)' for age 40, accident 1, resulting in 750. The student's code would produce 600 + (600 * 0.25) = 750 if age < 24 is false. For age 40, acc 1, it gets 750. For age 19, acc 0, it gets 600 + 200 = 800. For age 19, acc 2, it should be ineligible, but the code computes 800 (base + age) + 0.25 * 800 = 1000. This seems to align with the example '1,000' for 19yr old with 2 accidents, even though rule (i) states 'more than 2 accidents' means ineligible, and the student correctly identified '3 accidents' as ineligible. The example for 19yr old with 2 accidents resulting in 1000 is inconsistent with rule (i). Assuming the example is correct and rule (i) is 'age < 18 AND acc > 2' or 'age < 18 OR acc > 2', the student's code actually computes it correctly based on the *example* for age 19, 2 accidents. However, the *description* of the accident surcharge says 'an extra 25 % of the **total premium**'. This is ambiguous. Based on the example '40 | 1 | 750 | 600 (basic) + 25% of 600 (accidents surcharge)', it implies 25% of the *basic* amount is added. The student's code `pay = pay + (pay * 0.25);` adds 25% of the *current* `pay` value. For the 40, 1 accident case: base 600. Age < 24 is false. `acc > 0` is true, so `pay = 600 + (600 * 0.25) = 750`. This matches the 40, 1 example. For 19, 0 accidents: base 600. Age < 24 is true: `pay = 600 + 200 = 800`. `acc > 0` is false. Final pay is 800. This matches example. For 19, 2 accidents: base 600. Age < 24 is true: `pay = 600 + 200 = 800`. `acc > 0` is true: `pay = 800 + (800 * 0.25) = 1000`. This matches example. The student implemented the calculation exactly as per the examples, despite the ambiguity in the rule description about 'total premium'.

You correctly handled invalid negative inputs and the primary ineligibility rule. The core insurance calculation logic follows the provided examples closely.
