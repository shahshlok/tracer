The constructors and getter methods are implemented correctly, and the `displayInfo` method generally works as expected. However, there is a significant logical error in the `getVolume` method, and the no-argument constructor does not invoke the parameterized constructor as specified in the requirements. The code also lacks documentation and the test program is embedded within the `Cuboid` class. Addressing these points will significantly improve the submission.",
